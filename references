  abstract  = {Today’s great paradox is that we feel the impact of technology
               everywhere―in our cars, our phones, the supermarket, the doctor’s
               office―but not in our paychecks. In the past, technological
               advancements dramatically increased wages, but for three decades
               now, the median wage has remained stagnant. Machines have taken
               over much of the work of humans, destroying old jobs while
               increasing profits for business owners. The threat of
               ever-widening economic inequality looms, but in Learning by
               Doing, James Bessen argues that increased inequality is not
               inevitable. Workers can benefit by acquiring the knowledge and
               skills necessary to implement rapidly evolving technologies;
               unfortunately, this can take years, even decades. Technical
               knowledge is mostly unstandardized and difficult to acquire,
               learned through job experience rather than in the classroom. As
               Bessen explains, the right policies are necessary to provide
               strong incentives for learning on the job. Politically
               influential interests have moved policy in the wrong direction
               recently. Based on economic history as well as analysis of
               today’s labor markets, his book shows a way to restore broadly
               shared prosperity.},

                  capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
                  the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
                  nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the
                  ?epistemology of possession,? since it treats knowledge as
                  something people possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot
                  account for the knowing found in individual and group
                  practice. Knowing as action calls for an ?epistemology of
                  practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of possession tends to
                  privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and knowledge
                  possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
                  Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging
                  and by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
                  Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
                  individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct
                  and coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others
                  cannot), and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually
                  enabling (not competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of
                  knowing, that knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the
                  social and physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge
                  and knowing can generate new knowledge and new ways of
                  knowing. We believe this generative dance between knowledge
                  and knowing is a powerful source of organizational innovation.
                  Harnessing this innovation calls for organizational and
                  technological infrastructures that support the interplay of
                  knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these concepts make
                  possible a more robust framing of such
                  epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
                  management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these
                  views through three brief case studies drawn from recent
                  research.},

                  susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is
                  of particular concern when reviews address policy- and
                  practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been
                  introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing
                  evidence across studies; they rely on a suite of
                  evidence-based methods aimed at maximizing rigour and
                  minimizing susceptibility to bias. Despite the increasing
                  popularity of systematic reviews in the environmental field,
                  evidence synthesis methods continue to be poorly applied in
                  practice, resulting in the publication of syntheses that are
                  highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing the constraints that
                  researchers can sometimes feel when attempting to plan,
                  conduct and publish rigorous and comprehensive evidence
                  syntheses, we aim here to identify major pitfalls in the
                  conduct and reporting of systematic reviews, making use of
                  recent examples from across the field. Adopting a 'critical
                  friend' role in supporting would-be systematic reviews and
                  avoiding individual responses to police use of the 'systematic
                  review' label, we go on to identify methodological solutions
                  to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight existing support
                  available to avoid these issues and call on the entire
                  community, including systematic review specialists, to work
                  towards better evidence syntheses for better evidence and
                  better decisions.},

  abstract     = {Knowledge management (KM) has matured to the point that many
                  organisations either believe they have such practices in place
                  or at least understand they are relevant to the knowledge work
                  commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from
                  the literature, however, is a solid foundation for the
                  philosophies underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit
                  knowledge informs the KM space. Research over decades shows
                  tacit knowledge underpins all other forms of knowledge,
                  enabling the interpretation and judicious application of
                  knowledge, leading (at its highest levels) to the concept of
                  wisdom. As an academic discipline, artificial intelligence
                  (AI) was established before KM, has been grounded in the
                  computing discipline for many decades, and is applied broadly
                  in many domains. This paper explores how AI can inform the KM
                  debate. Rather than simply provide examples of AI success
                  stories as applied to KM in practice, it explores the
                  theoretical and practical limitations of AI and KM in unison,

                  comparing as-planned with as-built conditions in construction
                  projects do not readily add tangible intrinsic value to the
                  end-users. In large-scale construction projects, the process
                  of monitoring the implementation of every single part of
                  buildings and reflecting them on the BIM models can become
                  highly labour intensive and error-prone, due to the vast
                  amount of data produced in the form of schedules, reports and
                  photo logs. In order to address the mentioned methodological
                  and technical gap, this paper presents a framework and a proof
                  of concept prototype for on-demand automated simulation of
                  construction projects, integrating some cutting edge IT
                  solutions, namely image processing, machine learning, BIM and
                  Virtual Reality. This study utilised the Unity game engine to
                  integrate data from the original BIM models and the as-built
                  images, which were processed via various computer vision
                  techniques. These methods include object recognition and
                  semantic segmentation for identifying different structural
                  elements through supervised training in order to superimpose
                  the real world images on the as-planned model. The proposed
                  framework leads to an automated update of the 3D virtual
                  environment with states of the construction site. This
                  framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an
                  advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the
                  inconsistencies in an effective manner. This paper contributes
                  to body knowledge by providing a technical exemplar for the
                  integration of ML and image processing approaches with
                  immersive and interactive BIM interfaces, the algorithms and
                  program codes of which can help replicability of these

                  ascribes this to “gameplay”, the techniques used by game

  abstract    = {Skilled labor is vital to the success of any construction
                 project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the
                 skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry
                 has been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last
                 two decades for many reasons, including the poor image of
                 construction workers among the public, inadequate training
                 measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on
                 the matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay
                 and increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand
                 for labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor
                 grows. Poor worker retention practices were also identified as
                 a cause for shortage and a reason for workers leaving the
                 industry, and proper retention tactics are assessed, including
                 monetary and non-monetary considerations for workers in order
                 to foster a better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting
                 practices among labor unions and contractors are also assessed
                 through interviews and research, with the results suggesting
                 that a greater emphasis should be put on improving the image of
                 construction workers in the public eye, increasing the prestige
                 of a job in construction and leading to increased participation

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTThe UK is set to become Europe?s largest construction
                  market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity
                  performance is regarded as weak, with low skills levels
                  considered to be a key contributory factor. Consequently,
                  off-site construction has been identified by the UK Government
                  as a vehicle for improving productivity levels if the skills
                  deficiencies in this particular market segment can be
                  addressed. A series of projects were, therefore, launched by
                  the UK Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to
                  encourage an R\&D approach to skills and development
                  application in the workplace. This paper reports on one of
                  these research projects, a University and Industry
                  collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber
                  platform frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how
                  a needs analysis process was utilised to develop skills
                  training content tailored to the immediate needs of the
                  industry partners. It also explores how working with academia
                  and a wider community of stakeholders allowed this training
                  content to result in sector-level impact via knowledge
                  exchange activities and generic skills material creation.
                  Finally, the novel approach of utilising ?Hoshin? planning to
                  form a larger regional Offsite HUB (Scotland) Community of
                  Practice, with a developed plan for collaboration aligned with
                  international off-site research objectives, is also explained.
                  The case study presented in this paper is evidence of success
                  in mobilising industry through creating communities of
                  practice to advance the construction sector regionally. It
                  also provides a generalisable method that is reproducible by
                  other university?industry cohorts in order to realise shared
                  industry-wide goals.},

                 higher earnings brackets over the course of a career. Building
                 human capital also pays off for firms in the form of more

                  support thematic analysis using a publicly available interview
                  dataset from Lumivero. It introduces Guided AI Thematic
                  Analysis (GAITA), an adaptation of King et al.’s (2018)
                  Template Analysis. This framework positions researchers as a
                  reflexive instrument and intellectual leader while thoroughly
                  guiding GPT-4 in four stages: data familiarization;
                  preliminary coding; template formation and finalization; and
                  theme development. Additionally, the article proposes the
                  ACTOR framework, a simple approach to combining different
                  effective prompting techniques when working with GenAI for
                  qualitative research purposes. Findings reveal GenAI’s
                  capacity for analyzing the data, generating codes, subcodes,
                  clusters, and themes, along with its adaptive learning and
                  interactive assistance in organizing unstructured data and
                  developing trustworthiness. However, this model has some key
                  limitations in terms of its restricted context window for
                  processing large datasets, its inconsistent outputs requiring
                  multiple prompt attempts, the need to move across workspaces,

  abstract  = {The construction industry is labour intensive and hence
               significantly impacted by the skills and capabilities of the
               workforce. Given the rapid changes in construction processes due
               to digitalization and globalization, the development of emerging
               skills is essential to futureproof both professional and
               vocational personnel who seek employment under smart and modern
               construction in the 21st century. Correspondingly, the skills
               needed for offsite construction activities where buildings are
               produced within factories, will be drastically affected in the
               future. In such a scenario, skills of the workforce affiliated
               with a traditional construction style will become obsolete due to
               the mismatch between the industry needs and the skills
               availability. Therefore, this research aims to identify the skill
               categories required for smart and modern construction in an
               offsite construction platform. An industry engagement workshop
               activity in the form of a roundtable discussion comprising of
               both academics and industry participants was carried out for data
               collection. There were total of six tables with the composition
               of four industry practitioners and two academics on each table.
               The academics were responsible for moderating the discussion. The
               views held by the participants are analysed using thematic
               content analysis method to compute the skills required for smart
               and modern construction. Ten themes were produced from the 60
               skills identified by the participants. Themes were developed to
               identify the recurring skills in a single cluster. Findings of
               the data analysis procedure indicate that knowledge,
               interpersonal skills and the ability to embrace digital
               technology are the key skill categories needed for future smart
               and modern construction. Research reveals the key skills that
               need to be possessed by both vocational and professional
               employees in an industrialized construction environment in order
               to survive in the rapid modernization of the construction
               industry. The literature synthesis related to offsite and onsite
               construction skills also enable to rationalize the findings. The
               significant outcomes of the research are the need to possess
               digital skills, knowledge on manufacturing industry processes,
               interpersonal skills and adaptability to technology which allow
               the construction industry employees to thrive in the definite
               smart and modern construction platform.},

                  to lift these outputs into a consistent 3D scene

                  extends previous introductory descriptions of the Ecology of

                  between the elements in the Ecology of Resources are a
                  particular focus for discussion here. In particular, we
                  consider how we might use the Ecology of Resources model to
                  scaffold learning so that a wide range of the resources
                  available to a learner within their context can be used to
                  best support their learning needs. Resources here include
                  people, technologies and artifacts. We look for ways in which
                  they can be linked and marshaled in a learner centric manner
                  and draw on the HOMEWORK and VeSEL projects as practical
                  examples of the way the Ecology of Resources framework can be
                  used.},

  abstract     = {Flight simulation is a proven technique for training technical
                  and procedural skills, but team skills present needs that
                  remain unmet by simulator technology. Communication and
                  coordination, two skills representative of this gap, are
                  typically incorporated into simulation via human role players,
                  a practice that entails cost, introduces variation, and can
                  compromise availability of training. In this article we
                  explore the use of speech-interactive synthetic teammates to
                  bring team skills into simulation-based training. We report on
                  a US Air Force study that led to the development of a desktop
                  air traffic pattern simulation for practicing radio
                  communications, and present findings from a study conducted
                  with US Air Force student pilots who employed this system
                  during part of their pilot training. The work reported here
                  addresses two questions. First, can contemporary desktop
                  simulation augmented with intelligent agents and voice
                  recognition provide training gains in communications
                  performance among student pilots? Second, will users accept
                  this approach?},

  abstract  = {Open Building Manufacturing (ManuBuild) aims to promote the
               European construction industry beyond the state of the art.
               However, this requires the different stakeholders to be well
               informed of what ‘Open Building Manufacturing’ actually entails
               with respect to understanding the underlying concepts, benefits
               and risks. This is further challenged by the ‘traditional ways of
               learning’ which have been predominantly criticised for being
               entrenched in theories with little or no emphasis on practical
               issues. Experiential learning has long been suggested to overcome
               the problems associated with the traditional ways of learning. In
               this respect, it has the dual benefit of appealing to adult
               learner’s experience base, as well as increasing the likelihood
               of performance change through training. On-the-job-training (OJT)
               is usually sought to enable ‘experiential’ learning; and it is
               argued to be particularly effective in complex tasks, where a
               great deal of independence is granted to the task performer.
               However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited,
               and devoid of the actual training context. Consequently, in order
               to address the problems encountered with OJT, virtual reality
               (VR) solutions have been proposed to provide a risk free
               environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
               often faced on real construction projects. Since ManuBuild aims
               to promote the EU construction industry beyond the state of the
               art; training and education therefore needs also to go beyond the
               state of the art in order to meet future industry needs and
               expectations. Hence, a VR interactive learning environment was
               suggested for Open Building Manufacturing training to allow
               experiential learning to take place in a risk free environment,
               and consequently overcome the problems associated with OJT. This
               chapter discusses the development, testing, and validation of
               this prototype.},

               the writings of L.S. Vygotsky and sociologists whose work echoes
               his sociogenetic commitments, particularly Basil Bernstein. It
               provides a variety of views on the ways in which these two,
               conceptually linked, bodies of work can be brought together in
               theoretical frameworks which give new possibilities for empirical
               work. This book has two aims. First, to expand and enrich the
               Vygotskian theoretical framework; second, to illustrate the
               utility of such enhanced sociological imaginations and how they
               may be of value in researching learning in institutions and
               classrooms. It includes contributions from long-established
               writers in education, psychology and sociology, as well as
               relatively recent contributors to the theoretical debates and the
               body of research to which it has given rise, presenting their own

                  become increasingly integrated with artificial intelligence
                  techniques in order to develop more personalized educational
                  systems. These systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring
                  systems (ITSs). This paper focused on the variant
                  characteristics of ITSs developed across different educational
                  fields. The original studies from 2007 to 2017 were extracted
                  from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus, Google scholar, Embase,
                  Cochrane, and Web of Science databases. Finally, 53 papers
                  were included in the study based on inclusion criteria. The
                  educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer sciences
                  (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data mining,
                  and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
                  frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
                  intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
                  enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction,
                  evaluate learners, define and update the learner’s model, and
                  classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of
                  the system, learner’s performance, and experiences were used
                  for evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user
                  interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning

  abstract     = {The deskilling/reskilling controversy within the labour
                  process debate is considered within the context of the
                  implementation of Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM).
                  Effective implementation of CIM is shown to require an
                  appreciation of the social and organizational issues
                  associated with organizational change. As such the
                  deskilling/reskilling issue is worthy of analysis within the
                  CIM context and aspects of the labour process debate are
                  examined. The effects of technological change on the skills of
                  shopfloor oerators and supervisors are examined by analysing
                  two dimensions of skill, technical complexity and discretion
                  or autonomy. The paper concludes that the outcomes of
                  technical change are framed by managerial perceptions and
                  consequent decisions on how technology should be implemented
                  in terms of work organisation.},

               pandemic, to defend ourselves against global threats—it is
               faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital
               age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome
               than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap
               between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it’s
               not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a
               rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy
               from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the
               details of implementation. Lofty goals morph unrecognizably as
               they cascade through a complex hierarchy. But there is an
               approach taking hold that keeps pace with today’s world and
               reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve.
               Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the
               government we have today onto new technology and instead consider
               what it would mean to truly recode American government.},

  abstract     = {This article contends that deskilling is best understood not
                  as a distinct phenomenon, but as a component of a process Marx
                  (1993: 694) called ‘absorption’. Absorption involves not only
                  the extraction of capacities from labour but also their
                  implementation in machines. The article reads Braverman’s
                  (1998) analysis of Taylorism as a demonstration of how
                  absorption entails a specific labour process of its own, which
                  I call the absorption process. The nature of the absorption
                  process is contingent on many social factors. This article
                  focuses on a technical factor: the particular machines used to
                  implement captured skills and knowledge, called here the
                  infrastructure of absorption. Since technological capacities
                  are ever-evolving under capital due to the continual
                  revolutionizing of the means of production, infrastructures of
                  absorption change over time and this necessitates new
                  absorption processes. Braverman (1998: 132) pointed to a
                  qualitative change in absorption with the digital computer,
                  which he described in terms of a new ‘universality of the
                  machine’. While Braverman rightly pointed out the computer as
                  a novel infrastructure, he did not discern qualitative changes
                  to the absorption process, seeing instead the extension of
                  Taylorist processes of capture of knowledge and skill. I
                  contend that a qualitative shift has become apparent since the
                  rise of machine learning in around 2015. Machine learning
                  enables a different absorption process of emergence which does
                  not require the codification of captured knowledge. Much
                  labour process theory (LPT) (and adjacent) research presumes
                  that deskilling and automation operate in terms of a process
                  of capture, however, I show that emergence presents
                  qualitatively different means for both. I suggest that the
                  infrastructure of machine learning presents the possibility of
                  task-agnostic automation.},

  abstract  = {An exploration of how regional definitions of Appalachia vary
               geographically and culturally, discussing mapping efforts,
               sub-regions, and the social and economic factors that shape
               Appalachian identity. The article examines how the Appalachian
               region is defined and challenges the official boundaries set by
               the Appalachian Regional Commission. It argues that Appalachia is
               too geographically and culturally diverse to be treated as a
               single, uniform region. Using county-level mapping tools, the
               author experiments with alternative definitions and introduces
               sub-regions—such as the Great Valley Country, Holler Land, and
               Pittsburghia—to capture internal variations in terrain, economy,
               and identity. The discussion highlights how geography, economic
               ties, and local culture intersect to produce multiple overlapping
               “Appalachias,” suggesting that the region should be understood as
               a set of related but distinct places rather than one continuous
               whole.},

  abstract    = {This thesis reports on a study which uses a comparative
                 analysis of two ‘high-performing’ organisations in different
                 occupational sectors to identify aspects of workplace culture,
                 work processes, and strategic orientations which are associated
                 with innovation. The study investigates (1) the informal
                 features of organisational culture, work processes and
                 strategic orientation that support innovation; (2) how these
                 features practically interrelate with the formal structures,
                 policies and procedures of these organisations; and (3) how
                 learning, innovation and practice are interrelated conceptually
                 and practically. Interviews and focus groups with teams of
                 practitioners within each organisation (n=24) were analysed to
                 develop a conceptual understanding of the links between
                 practice, learning and innovation which builds on and extends
                 previous research on organisational development,
                 capacity-building, work process design and culture. Its
                 findings provide evidence supporting earlier studies suggesting
                 that (1) ‘expansive’ rather than ‘restrictive’ organisations
                 (Fuller and Unwin 2004) are more likely to be innovative; (2)
                 cultures, work processes and arrangements providing productive
                 conditions and opportunities for employee learning, and
                 particularly for informal learning within and between teams,
                 will also provide productive conditions for innovation; (3) the
                 behaviours, activities and cultures within and across teams,
                 including relationships and team-working practices that produce
                 effective learning by team members, also support innovation;
                 (4) aiming to embed ‘innovativeness’ widely across
                 organisations, rather than treating innovation only as a matter
                 for specialists, is likely to be effective in supporting
                 innovation in contexts of rapid change; and finally (5)
                 organisational orientation towards particular kinds of
                 partnership working and mutuality, together with corporate
                 commitment to expansive notions of ‘public value’ are
                 associated with innovation. The study proposes refinements to
                 the way the interplay between learning, innovation and practice
                 is conceptualised, and introduces the concepts of ‘tacit
                 pedagogy’ and ‘entanglement.’},

               ever-changing cultural and technological environment. Teaching is

               architects, engineers, programmers OCo teachers have to work out
               creative and evidence-based ways of improving what they do. Yet
               teaching is not treated as a design profession. Every day,
               teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning
               technology to help their students. Sadly, their discoveries often
               remain local. By representing and communicating their best ideas
               as structured pedagogical patterns, teachers could develop this
               vital professional knowledge collectively. Teacher professional

               expansion in the use of pre-assembled components, which are
               fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively, such
               processes are becoming known as *offsite construction*. A

               offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,

               researchers who study the transformation of practice through the
               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an important
               moment for such a contribution because expertise is in transition
               - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational fields and
               continuous shaping of transformations. To understand and master
               this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are needed and are
               provided here. The theoretical framework which has shaped these
               studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). CHAT
               analyses how people and organisations learn to do something new,
               and how both individuals and organisations change. The
               theoretical and methodological tools used have their origins in
               the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont’ev. In recent years this
               body of work has aroused significant interest across the social
               sciences, management and communication studies. Working as part
               of an integrated international team, the authors identify
               specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic
               community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning between
               operational and strategic levels within complex organizations;
               the refinement of notions of identity and subject position within
               CHAT; the introduction of the concept of ‘labour power’ into
               CHAT; the development of a method of analysing discourse which
               theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design of projects.
               Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful to
               practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who are
               interested in conceptual and empirical issues in all aspects of

               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required
               to understand how learning in the workplace can be improved.},

               productivity. Investing in their (or one’s own development) is
               assumed to result in economic dividends. As Garrick argues, ‘The

               then [the emergence of human capital theory], fuelled a very

  abstract  = {This chapter critically examines the heightened scrutiny of
               low-wage workers, both employed and unemployed, effected through
               the widespread use of ‘basic skills’ assessments. Employers are
               increasingly using literacy, numeracy and language skills
               assessments as the basis of hiring decisions as well as a range
               of other employment decisions, including promotion, assignment or
               reassignment, and firing. Assessment is used in ‘workplace basic
               skills’ programmes, both in the ‘needs assessment’ phase prior to
               the establishment of programmes and in the post-programmes
               ‘learning assessment’ phase. In the workplace, the unequal nature
               of the employment relationship and the requirement for programmes
               of education or training to have a measurable impact on
               profitability tend to conflict with the need for the
               dispassionate and unthreatening assessment required in programmes
               of fundamental education. This tendency has been magnified in the
               recent past as performance on literacy, numeracy and language
               proficiency assessments has been interpreted as a consummate
               indicator of ‘fitness’ for work. The chapter concludes that the
               use of ‘basic skills’ assessments represents an area of
               fundamental conflict between capital and labour and that, in
               cases where training programmes are designed to remediate basic
               skills ‘deficiencies’, the quality of the training itself is
               frequently as problematic as the assessment.},

               in ways often inherently pedagogical. Individuals, likewise,

               goals and directions. Core tensions in this relationship are
               between these two sets of continuities. A critique of the current

               knowledge, including knowledge of how more formal, explicit
               knowledge is used in various practice settings. The second half
               focuses on transfer as a learning process, which requires both
               understanding and positive commitment from individual learners,
               formal education, employers and local workplace managers.
               Transfer is conceptualized in terms of five stages, whose
               distinctive characteristics and learning challenges are discussed
               in some detail. The neglect of transfer is attributed both to the
               cultural gap between formal education and the workplace and
               profound ignorance of the nature and amount of the learning
               involved.},

  abstract  = {In the current political context, there are pressures for
               scientific research to objectively identify effective learning,
               in the workplace as elsewhere, for example by measuring the
               attainments of such learning. Drawing upon empirical data, we
               argue that this is counter-productive. Workplace learning is
               complex, yet a research focus on measured attainments implicitly
               defines such learning in a narrow way, within an acquisition
               perspective. This severely restricts the range of learning that
               can be recognized. Ironically, the very types of learning likely
               to be excluded are some of the most common and significant. To
               gain a better understanding of workplace learning and to
               effectively improve it, we need to resist scientific
               reductionism, and work with more holistic theoretical and
               methodological approaches.},

               and development and industrial relations. As the skills agenda
               has moved to the forefront of public conversation, in a practical
               sense training and development have become more of an industrial
               relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social actors to
               cooperate and build new partnership relations around skills,
               training, and learning to help address the challenges of building
               more productive economies. The chapter considers the conceptual
               underpinnings of the industrial relations of training, before
               reviewing developments in the British training system, notably in
               terms of trade union?led learning initiatives, within a more
               comparative context. The analysis suggests that the industrial
               relations of training are heavily influenced by the institutional
               structures and legacies that help to regulate potential conflicts
               of interest around training and development. However, ?mutual

               leader took the ideas in this book seriously, the world would be
               a less miserable, more productive place." Every organization is
               plagued by destructive friction. Yet some forms of friction are
               incredibly useful, and leaders who attempt to improve workplace
               efficiency often make things even worse. Drawing from seven years
               of hands-on research, The Friction Project by bestselling authors
               Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao teaches readers how to become
               "friction fixers." Sutton and Rao kick off the book by unpacking
               how skilled friction fixers think and act like trustees of
               others' time. They provide friction forensics to help readers
               identify where to avert and repair bad organizational friction
               and where to maintain and inject good friction. Then their help
               pyramid shows how friction fixers do their work, from reframing
               friction troubles they can't fix right now, so they feel less
               threatening, to designing and repairing organizations. The heart
               of the book digs into the causes and solutions for five of the
               most common and damaging friction troubles: oblivious leaders,
               addition sickness, broken connections, jargon monoxide, and fast
               and frenzied people and teams. Sound familiar? Sutton and Rao are
               here to help. They wrap things up with lessons for leading your
               own friction project, including linking little things to big
               things; the power of civility, caring, and love for propelling
               designs and repairs; and embracing the mess that is an inevitable
               part of the process (while still trying to clean it up).},

               prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one: since the
               19th century, designers, inventors, engineers, builders,
               developers, and entrepreneurs have all been fascinated by the

                  various training purposes. However, principles for determining
                  training-schedule design for efficient utilization of these
                  systems are not well established. The present research
                  compared performance of two groups, one adopting a mixed
                  practice schedule (with high contextual interference) and the
                  other employing a blocked practice schedule (presumably with

                  to achieved skill level and skill consistency. A possible
                  reason is that the complexity of the training task created a

                  schedule comparable to the interference created by the mixed

               Derek Thompson puts pop culture under the lens of science to
               answer the question that every business, every producer, every
               person looking to promote themselves and their work has asked.
               Drawing on ancient history and modern headlines - from vampire
               lore and Brahms's Lullaby to Instagram - Thompson explores the
               economics and psychology of why certain things become
               extraordinarily popular. With incisive analysis and captivating
               storytelling, he reveals that, though blockbuster films, Internet
               memes and number-one songs seem to have come out of nowhere, hits
               actually have a story and operate by certain rules. People
               gravitate towards familiar surprises: products that are bold and
               innovative, yet instantly comprehensible. Whether he is
               uncovering the secrets of JFK and Barack Obama's speechwriters or
               analysing the unexpected reasons for the success of Fifty Shades
               of Grey, Thompson goes beyond the cultural phenomena that make
               the news by revealing the desires that make us all human. While
               technology might change, he shows, our innate preferences do not,
               and throughout history hits have held up a mirror to ourselves.

               from small-scale Etsy entrepreneurs to the origin of Star Wars,

                  While the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is
                  trapped on two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf
                  between the real and digital worlds prevents us from fully
                  exploiting the volumes of information now available to us.
                  Augmented reality, a set of technologies that superimposes
                  digital data and images on physical objects and environments,
                  is closing this gap. By putting information directly into the
                  context in which we’ll apply it, AR increases our ability to
                  absorb and act on it. AR will become the new interface between
                  humans and machines, say Michael E. Porter of Harvard and
                  James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of the industrial software maker
                  PTC. Many people are familiar with AR entertainment
                  applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR is being
                  applied in far more consequential ways in business. Pioneering
                  organizations are already implementing it in product
                  development, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, service, and
                  training—and are seeing major gains in quality and
                  productivity. AR improves how users visualize information,
                  receive and follow instructions, and interact with products.
                  AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts the
                  heat signature of a patient’s veins into an image superimposed
                  on the skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR
                  to show trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing—and has cut
                  the time it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory
                  workers have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using
                  voice commands in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR
                  will have a wide impact on how companies compete. This article
                  walks readers through the questions firms need to ask when

                  article also includes HBR’s first embedded AR experiences,
                  which readers can launch by downloading a new HBR app on their
                  mobile devices and then pointing them at targeted images in

               English economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) that argues

               instead for government intervention to manage a modern economy
               and ensure stability. Keynes believed the role of the state
               should be determined case-by-case, rather than by a general rule,
               and challenged the notion that the market alone could solve
               problems like unemployment. This work, based on lectures from
               1924 and 1926, is a fundamental text that presciently questioned
               laissez-faire policies and continues to influence debates about
               the state's role in the economy.},

                  management and organization studies. While several scholars
                  have reflected on this technique, comparatively few
                  researchers have explicated the specific practices that
                  constitute this method and discussed their implications for
                  research on processes of organizing. The purpose of this
                  article is to address these issues by offering a conceptual
                  toolbox that defines shadowing in terms of a set of framing
                  practices and provides in‐depth insight into the
                  methodological choices and challenges that organizational
                  shadowers may encounter.Design/methodology/approachIn this
                  article, the authors explicate the specific framing practices
                  in which researchers engage when taking an intersubjective
                  approach to organizational shadowing. To demonstrate the value
                  of viewing shadowing as framing, the paper grounds the
                  theoretical discussion in actual fieldwork experiences, taken
                  from three different ethnographic studies.FindingsBased on a
                  systematic and critical analysis of fieldwork experiences, the
                  paper argues that organizational shadowing is constituted by
                  three interrelated framing practices: delineating the object
                  of study; punctuating the process/flow of a given organizing
                  process; and reflecting on the relationship between researcher
                  and the object(s) or person(s) being observed. These
                  analytical constructs highlight specific activities with which
                  shadowers are confronted in the field, namely foregrounding
                  and backgrounding particular aspects in defining a given
                  object of study, trying to keep this object in focus as the
                  fieldwork unfolds, and making decisions about the degree to
                  which the relationship with shadowees should be taken into
                  account in understanding this object.Originality/valueThis
                  article provides an in‐depth reflection on the subtle
                  practices that constitute organizational shadowing. It offers
                  a useful conceptual toolbox for researchers who want to use
                  this method and demonstrates its operational value to help
                  them understand how knowledge construction is the outcome of a
                  coconstructive process that depends on a series of decisions
                  negotiated in ongoing interactions with the actors under

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.},

               New York Times bestselling co-author of Raising Cain In 1994,
               Driven to Distraction sparked a revolution in our understanding
               of attention deficit disorder. Widely recognized as the classic
               in the field, the book has sold more than a million copies. Now a
               second revolution is under way in the approach to ADD, and the
               news is great. Drug therapies, our understanding of the role of
               diet and exercise, even the way we define the disorder - all are
               changing radically. And doctors are realizing that millions of
               adults suffer from this condition, though the vast majority of
               them remain undiagnosed and untreated. In this new book, Drs
               Edward M. Hallowell and John J. Ratey build on the breakthroughs
               of Driven to Distraction to offer a comprehensive and entirely
               up-to-date guide to living a successful life with ADD. As
               Hallowell and Ratey point out, 'attention deficit disorder' is a
               highly misleading description of an intriguing kind of mind.
               Original, charismatic, energetic, often brilliant, people with
               ADD have extraordinary talents and gifts embedded in their highly
               charged but easily distracted minds. Tailored expressly to ADD
               learning styles and attention spans, Delivered from Distraction
               provides accessible, engaging discussions of every aspect of the
               condition, from diagnosis to finding the proper treatment regime.
               Inside you'll discover: - whether ADD runs in families - new
               diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations - the links between
               ADD and other conditions - how people with ADD can free up their
               inner talents and strengths - the new drugs and how they work,
               and why they're not for everyone - exciting advances in
               nonpharmaceutical therapies, including changes in diet, exercise,
               and lifestyle - how to adapt the classic twelve-step program to
               treat ADD - sexual problems associated with ADD and how to
               resolve them - strategies for dealing with procrastination,

               have triumphed, Delivered from Distraction is a wise, loving
               guide to releasing the positive energy that all people with ADD

               Ratey literally 'wrote the book' on ADD/ADHD more than two
               decades ago. Their bestseller, Driven to Distraction, largely
               introduced this diagnosis to the public and sold more than a
               million copies along the way. Now, most people have heard of ADHD
               and know someone who may have it. But lost in the discussion of
               both childhood and adult diagnosis of ADHD is the potential
               upside: many hugely successful entrepreneurs and highly creative
               people attribute their achievements to ADHD. Also unknown to most
               are the recent research developments, including innovations that

               home, at school, or in the workplace - to enhance the creativity
               and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace
               innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings
               about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum, which

               shame-free guide, the creator of the award-winning YouTube
               channel How to ADHD shares the hard-won insights and practical
               strategies that have helped her survive, even thrive, in a world
               not built for her brain. “The world of ADHD has been waiting for
               this book with bated breath for many years. If there’s a fairy
               godmother of our lot, it’s Jessica McCabe.”—Edward Hallowell, MD,
               coauthor of Driven to Distraction and ADHD 2.0 Forget “try
               harder.” When your brain works differently, you need to try
               different. Diagnosed with ADHD at age twelve, Jessica struggled
               with a brain that she didn’t understand. She lost things
               constantly, couldn’t finish projects, and felt like she was
               putting more effort in than everyone around her while falling
               further and further behind. At thirty-two years old—broke,
               divorced, and living with her mom—Jessica decided to look more
               deeply into her ADHD challenges. She reached out to experts,
               devoured articles, and shared her discoveries on YouTube. In How
               to ADHD, Jessica reveals the tools that have changed her life
               while offering an unflinching look at the realities of living
               with ADHD. The key to navigating a world not built for the
               neurodivergent brain, she discovered, isn’t to fix or fight
               against its natural tendencies but to understand and work with
               them. She explains how ADHD affects everyday life, covering
               executive function impairments, rejection sensitivity,
               difficulties with attention regulation, and more. You’ll also
               find ADHD-specific strategies for adapting your environment,
               routines, and systems, including: • Boost the signal and decrease
               the noise. Facilitate focus by putting your goals where you can
               see them and fighting distractions with distractions. • Have less
               stuff to manage. Learn why you have trouble planning and
               prioritizing, and why doing more starts with doing less. • Build
               your “time wisdom.” Work backward when you plan, and track how
               long it actually takes you to do something. • Learn about your
               emotions. Understand how naming your emotions and letting
               yourself experience them can make them easier to regulate. With
               quotes from Jessica’s online community, chapter summaries, and
               reading shortcuts designed for the neurodivergent reader, How to
               ADHD will help you recognize your strengths and challenges,
               tackle “bad brain days,” and be kinder to yourself in the
               process.},

               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of
               occupations they engage in, the standing of, and the
               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’
               well-being, competence and progress. Ultimately, this book argues
               that the provision of vocational education needs to realise

  abstract  = {Rapid ethnographies are used in a wide range of fields to speed
               up research quickly and effectively. This book is the first
               practical guide to rapid ethnographies, helping readers to
               improve skills in the design, implementation, dissemination and
               use of findings generated through rapid ethnographic research. It
               gives advice and guidelines for carrying out rapid and rigorous
               research and provides details of tools used in the field.
               Vignettes reflecting on the author's research are included
               throughout, including observations on research carried out during
               the COVID-19 pandemic, to highlight how challenges of conducting
               rapid ethnographies can be overcome. Case studies across a range
               of subjects are also included, to demonstrate how rapid
               ethnographies can be applied in practice. With its useful tools
               and easy-to-read format, it will be used by teachers and
               students, as well as researchers wanting to successfully
               implement rapid ethnographies in their own work.},

               one of four privacy-preserving, deliberately coarse-grained
               categories (HOME, WORK, SCHOOLorELSEWHERE) In use, the Clock
               supported not only family co-ordination but also more emotive
               aspects of family life such as reassurance, connectedness,
               identity and social touch. This emphasized aspects of family life
               frequently neglected in Ubicomp, such as the ways in which
               families’ awareness of each others’ activities contributes to a
               sense of a family’s identity. We draw further on the results to
               differentiate between location as a technical aspect of awareness
               systems and what we characterize as “location-in-interaction”.
               Location-in-interaction is revealed as an emotional, accountable
               and even moral part of family life.},

  abstract  = {There are a number of theoretical positions that inform analyses
               of skill. One such position is the social construction of skill.
               When it was first proposed it was driven by feminist concerns
               about the sex-typing of jobs and women’s exclusion from jobs
               labelled as skilled. This chapter offers a new social
               construction of skill. It appreciates that the old social
               construction of skill has not disappeared but points out that the
               context within which this construction occurred has changed, with
               weaker labour unions and the decline in the manufacturing
               industries. With more service jobs and stronger employers, the
               chapter argues that in the wealthier countries there have been
               two shifts: a shift in how skill has been defined and a shift in
               who has the power to define it. Focusing on gender, race and
               class, the chapters explains how the social construction of skill
               has been restructured in three ways. First, more importance is
               attached to ascription of skill. Second, who is and isn’t deemed
               to be skilled has changed. Third, the lines between achieved and
               ascribed skill are increasingly blurred. The chapter finishes by
               suggesting ways in which the discrimination arising from this new
               social construction of skill might be addressed.},

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,
               into something more ‘integrative’. We believe a focus on context,
               power and perspective, within an understanding of the
               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process
               of change management within education and training. We offer an
               analysis of our template for change within education and training
               in the accountancy profession framed within a discussion of those
               aspects of context, power and perspective salient in this case.},

               elaborates on knowledge communication systems, basic issues, and
               tutorial dialogues. Concerns cover natural reasoning and tutorial
               dialogues, shift from local strategies to multiple mental models,
               domain knowledge, pedagogical knowledge, implicit versus explicit
               encoding of knowledge, knowledge communication, and practical and
               theoretical implications. The text then examines interactive
               simulations, existing CAI traditions, and learning environments.
               The manuscript elaborates on knowledge communication, didactics,
               and diagnosis. Topics include knowledge presentation and
               communication, pedagogical contexts, target levels of didactic
               operations, behavioral and epistemic diagnosis, and aspects of
               diagnostic experience. The publication is a dependable reference
               for researchers interested in the computational and cognitive

               myth-busting guide to AI past and present, one of the world's
               leading researchers shows why our fears for the future are
               misplaced.The ultimate dream of AI is to build machines that are
               like us: conscious and self-aware. While this remains a remote
               possibility, rapid progress in AI is already transforming our
               world. Yet the public debate is still largely centred on unlikely
               prospects, from sentient machines to dystopian robot takeovers.In
               this lively and clear-headed guide, Michael Wooldridge challenges
               the prevailing narrative, revealing how the hype distracts us
               from both the more immediate risks that this technology poses -
               from algorithmic bias to fake news - and the true life-changing

               the discoveries of AI's greatest pioneers from Alan Turing to

               research as a systematic process, describes how to formulate
               research questions, provides an in-depth explanation of different
               research methods (qualitative, quantitative, and experimental),
               and explains how to select appropriate research methods and
               execute research studies. It describes the process of
               documentation, knowledge dissemination, and application of
               research results in architectural design and practice. Most
               importantly, it provides guidelines for integrating research into
               profession and uses extensive case-studies and practice-relevant
               examples to illustrate main concepts, procedures, and
               applications. Integrating research into practice is essential for
               developing new knowledge, solving design and technical problems,
               overcoming different types of challenges present in the
               contemporary profession, and improving the design outcomes.
               Innovation requires a much stronger correlation between research
               and design, and it is pertinent for the future of architectural
               practice that research becomes an integral part of architectural
               profession. This book provides a roadmap for successfully
               integrating research into architectural design and for
               establishing innovative practices, regardless of a firm’s size.
               Written by an architecture professor with an extensive research
               and professional background—specifically focusing on integrating
               research into practice—and richly illustrated with over 150 color

  abstract  = {The three concepts central to this volume—practice, learning and
               change—have received very different treatments in the educational
               literature, an oversight directly confronted here. While learning
               and change have been extensively theorised, their various
               contexts articulated and analysed, practice is notably
               underrepresented. Where much of the literature on learning and
               change takes the notion of ‘practice’ as an unexamined given, its
               co-location as a term with various classifiers, as in ‘legal
               practice’ and ‘teaching practice’, render it curiously devoid of
               semantic force.In this book, ‘practice’ is the super-ordinate
               organising idea. Drawing on what has been termed the ‘practice
               turn in contemporary theory’, the work develops a conceptual
               framework for researching learning in, and on, practice. It
               challenges received notions of practice, questioning the
               assumptions, elisions, conflations and silences on the subject.
               In so doing, it offers fresh insights into learning and change,
               and how they relate to practice. In tandem with this conceptual
               work, the book details site-ontological studies of practice and
               learning in diverse professional and workplace contexts,
               examining the work of occupations as various as doctors, chefs
               and orchestral musicians. It demonstrates the value of theorising
               practice, learning and change, as well as exploring the
               connections between them amid our evolving social and

  abstract  = {This book centres on a broadened view of complexity that will
               enrich engagement with complexity in the social sciences. The key
               idea is to employ complexity theory to develop a holistic account
               of practice, agency and expertise. In doing so, the book
               acknowledges and builds upon the relational character of
               reductive accounts. It draws upon recent theoretical work on
               complexity, emergence and relationality to develop a novel
               account of practice, agency and expertise in and for workplaces.
               Biological, psychological and social aspects of these are
               integrated. This novel account overcomes problems in current
               views of practice, agency and expertise, which suffer from
               reductive, or fragmented, analyses, based upon individuals,
               groups, or networks. In retrieving the experiential richness of
               human activity – often esteemed as the basis of generative and
               creative life – this book shows how complexity both emerges from,
               and is, a non-reductive feature of, human experience, especially
               in daily work.“...an ambitiously wide-ranging volume, questioning
               the key tenets of respected approaches ..... and offering .....
               ‘novel accounts’, which draw on features of complexity
               thinking.... ...But they go further than any of us in their
               argument that: ‘whatever reductive moves are made, they ‘flow’
               from holistic accounts of relationality which have already
               affectively engaged the purposes of a co-present group.’ This is
               the intellectual contribution that is built consistently and
               persuasively across the chapters.” Professor Emerita Anne
               Edwards, Oxford University"Hager and Beckett have written a book
               that will challenge more commonly held notions of agency,
               practice, skills, and learning. Centering their argument on
               complexity theory or, as they prefer, complexity thinking, Hager
               and Beckett argue that it is through relations that we raise
               questions about, gather data from, and make working sense of the
               complexity that surrounds us. Groups then, particularly small
               groups, hold and implement agentive power. And what the authors
               call co-present groups—ones in which holistic relationality
               occurs socially, and affectively in distinctive places—“draw us
               closer to each other, and harness our normativity by enabling
               negotiability and reason-giving.” If your field of study involves
               anything remotely sociocultural in nature or if you are just
               interested in the complex ways we engage as humans with our
               worlds, you should find a place for this book in your

               bring together the practical and the theoretical, enabling
               readers to build expertise on the principles and practice of case
               study research, as well as engaging with possible theoretical
               frameworks. They also highlight the place of case study as a key
               component of educational research. With the help of this book,
               M-Level students, teacher educators and practitioner researchers

  abstract  = {The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.},

  abstract  = {Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an
               international readership of undergraduate and postgraduate

               a course of learning across different school- and work-based
               practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
               boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
               boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
               discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
               between school and work practices have frequently been reported
               as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
               individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
               relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
               chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential of
               boundary crossing between school and work practices, which we
               summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms: identification,
               coordination, perspective making and taking (or mutual
               reflection), and transformation. These learning mechanisms are
               discussed through illustrations from vocational education and
               training. The chapter concludes by speculating on what would be
               fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a vocational
               curriculum could be improved.},

                  substantially manual. Project information is primarily
                  exchanged via paper documents, and the visualization of the
                  facility is marginally communicated using 2D drawings.
                  Functions are generally planned independently of one another.
                  Previous research efforts developed systems that are
                  characterized as responsive decision systems, relying mainly
                  on programmed knowledge and heuristics for decision-making;

               have recognized their unique talents and made a successful living

               find ourselves in our Element, and achieve everything we're

               business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more
               comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind
               can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we
               live.This inspired him to start a journey around his own house,
               an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room
               considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the
               way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of
               anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from
               food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the
               Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant,
               creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered
               that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as
               our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest
               and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the
               corners of every home.},

               requires a comprehensive model of task and user behavior that
               considers different skill and knowledge levels as well as diverse
               situations. In this study, we investigated the relationships
               between user behaviors and skill levels under operational
               conditions. We captured sixty samples of two sewing tasks
               performed by five operators using a head-mounted RGB-d camera and
               a static gaze tracker. We examined the operators’ gaze and head
               movements, and hand interactions to essential regions (hotspots)
               to determine behavioral differences among continuous skill
               improving experiences. The experimental results indicate that
               some features, such as task execution time and user head
               movements, are good indexes for skill level and provide valuable
               information that can be applied to obtain an effective task
               model. Operators with varying knowledge and operating habits
               demonstrate different operational features, which can contribute
               to the design of user-specific guidance.},

               field, highlighting the key issues and everyday ethical dilemmas
               that researchers are likely to face in different contexts.
               Covering a range of methods, the book provides clear guidance for
               researchers on how to identify an approach that fits with their
               moral and intellectual framework. It explores ethical issues

                  buildings, the majority of existing buildings is not
                  maintained, refurbished or deconstructed with BIM yet.
                  Promising benefits of efficient resource management motivate
                  research to overcome uncertainties of building condition and
                  deficient documentation prevalent in existing buildings. Due
                  to rapid developments in BIM research, involved stakeholders
                  demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM implementation and
                  research in existing buildings. This paper presents a review
                  of over 180 recent publications on the topic. Results show
                  scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet, due to
                  challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
                  captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating
                  of information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data,
                  objects and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings.
                  Despite fast developments and spreading standards, challenging
                  research opportunities arise from process automation and BIM
                  adaption to existing buildings' requirements.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Augmented reality (AR), a state-of-the-art technology
                  for superimposing information onto the real world, has
                  recently started to affect our daily lives. AR applications
                  are becoming mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends
                  in AR applications for architecture, engineering,
                  construction, and facility management (AEC/FM). This paper
                  specifically focuses on four technologies—localization,
                  natural user interface (NUI), cloud computing, and mobile
                  devices—which have the potential to influence the development
                  of AR applications. Advances in localization technology will
                  enable the deployment of AR in a complex environment. An NUI
                  provides more convenient and intuitive user experiences, which
                  can increase the usability of AR. Cloud computing environments
                  allow users with internet access to ubiquitously retrieve
                  information from almost anywhere. Hence, cloud computing
                  increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM applications.
                  Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of AR is that
                  mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful, and less
                  expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101 research
                  efforts, and outlines the research trends and opportunities
                  for applying AR in the fields of AEC/FM.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Construction is a high hazard industry which involves
                  many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety
                  has always been advocated by many construction companies, and
                  they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
                  protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
                  Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a
                  witnessed trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive
                  VR/AR applications to create forgiving environments for
                  visualizing complex workplace situations, building up
                  risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing training. To better
                  understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in
                  construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the
                  related issues and propose possible improvements, this paper
                  starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for
                  several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training
                  and evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of
                  well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with
                  a generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology
                  characteristics, application domains, safety scenarios and
                  evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a number of
                  technical features and types that could be implemented in the
                  context of construction safety enhancement are derived and
                  further elaborated, while significant application domains and
                  trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e.,
                  hazards recognition and identification, safety training and
                  education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last
                  but not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived
                  from the in-depth review and comes up with the prospective
                  research works. It is envisioned that the outcomes of this
                  paper could assist both researchers and industrial
                  practitioners with appreciating the research and practice
                  frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the latest VR/AR

  abstract     = {Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
                  enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
                  However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to
                  communicate the 3D BIM content to construction personnel.
                  While Mixed Reality (MR) could theoretically be the primary
                  means of communicating BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D,
                  there is not currently a thorough understanding of how this
                  might impact the construction performance of industry
                  practitioners. This paper explores this topic by examining the
                  field of electrical construction. It addresses research
                  questions related to: MR's influence on the productivity and
                  quality of electrical conduit construction; and the effects of
                  an industry practitioner's background on his or her
                  performance using MR. To address these topics, a
                  quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance
                  of eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked
                  with building similar conduit assemblies using traditional
                  paper and MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity
                  questionnaires to provide their perceptions of the experience.
                  The results suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher
                  productivity rate; reduced the time required to understand the
                  design; led to fewer errors during the assembly process; and
                  increased the number of accurately constructed conduits as
                  compared to the conduits constructed using traditional paper.
                  Additionally, nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy
                  to use, but most still felt that they would prefer to use
                  paper plans for design communication. The findings of this
                  work were noteworthy because many of the participants had
                  substantial prior experience constructing conduit using paper
                  plans, yet they still performed the task better and faster
                  using MR. While the small sample size limits the extent to
                  which these findings can be generalized, the contribution of
                  this work is in demonstrating, as a proof-of-concept, that MR
                  can be a viable option for communicating existing BIM content
                  to current industry practitioners and that it can offer
                  advantages that are not currently observed through the use of
                  a paper-based communication methods.},

                  this study was to analyze the different learning processes
                  undertaken by novices and experts. Twenty semi-structured
                  interviews were conducted with novice and expert nurses for
                  the purpose of analyzing and comparing how their learning
                  developed in clinical practice. Results indicated that novice
                  learning is contingent on concept formation and assimilation.
                  Novice learning is also framed by the feelings novices
                  experience in the context of practice. Expert learning, on the
                  other hand, was identified as a constructivist process using
                  active concept integration and self-initiated strategies.

               development for various forms of immersive learning environments,
               and also the emerging innovations in assessment and research in
               the field. In addition, it demonstrates the opportunities and
               challenges in implementing advances in VR and immersion at scale
               in formal and informal learning.We are living in a time of rapid
               advances in terms of both the capabilities and the cost of
               virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, and various
               forms of mixed reality. These new media potentially offer
               extraordinary opportunities for enhancing both motivation and
               learning across a range of subject areas, student developmental
               levels, and educational settings. With the development of
               practical and affordable virtual reality and mixed reality,
               people now have the chance to experience immersive learning both
               in classrooms and informally in homes, libraries, and community
               centers. The book appeals to a broad readership including

  abstract  = {A New York Times Bestseller A revolution is under way. In recent
               years, Google’s autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on
               American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software,
               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,
               The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of
               technological, societal, and economic progress.},

  abstract  = {How should we train? What should we learn? What is our value?
               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the
               opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design.
               It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various technological
               trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban,
               spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture.

               values are the most fundamental condition for human existence.
               However, we now live in the “meaningless” and “value-less” world

               and more learners plugged into the online world. How can schools
               make the most of both the technology and the learning potential
               of today’s “born digital” students? In this new edition of their
               groundbreaking book, Collins and Halverson argue that new
               technologies have transformed our workplaces, our lives, and our
               culture and it is time we take the next step to transform
               learning—in and out of schools. The authors show how, over time,
               public schooling was so successful that it became synonymous with
               education. But new technologies risk making schools obsolete and
               this book explains why and how today’s educators, policymakers,
               and communities must adapt to provide all learners with access to
               the new learning tools of the 21st century.},

                  must be developed to support collecting, archiving, analyzing,
                  reporting, and collaboratively sharing video? and (d) Ethics:

  abstract     = {‘Setting’ is a widespread practice in the UK, despite little
                  evidence of its efficacy and substantial evidence of its
                  detrimental impact on those allocated to the lowest sets.
                  Taking a Bourdieusian approach, we propose that setting can be
                  understood as a practice through which the social and cultural
                  reproduction of dominant power relations is enacted within
                  schools. Drawing on survey data from 12,178 Year 7 (age 11/12)
                  students and discussion groups and individual interviews with
                  33 students, conducted as part of a wider project on secondary
                  school grouping practices, we examine the views of students
                  who experience setting, exploring the extent to which the
                  legitimacy of the practice is accepted or challenged, focusing
                  on students’ negative views about setting. Analyses show that
                  privileged students (White, middle class) were most likely to
                  be in top sets whereas working‐class and Black students were
                  more likely to be in bottom sets. Students in the lowest sets
                  (and boys, Black students and those in receipt of free school
                  meals) were the most likely to express negative views of
                  setting and to question the legitimacy and ‘fairness’ of
                  setting as a practice, whereas top‐set students defended the
                  legitimacy of setting and set allocations as ‘natural’ and
                  ‘deserved’. This paper argues that setting is incompatible
                  with social justice approaches to education and calls for the
                  foregrounding of the views of those who are disadvantaged by
                  the practice as a tool for challenging the doxa of setting.},

  abstract  = {Most Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers are accustomed
               to the process of formal ethics review for their evaluation or
               field trial protocol. Although this process varies by country,
               the underlying principles are universal. While this process is
               often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with
               vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging
               to navigate -- a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet,
               in many cases, foreign to HCI researchers. Nevertheless, with the
               increase in new areas of research such as mobile technologies for
               marginalized populations or assistive technologies, this is a
               current reality. In this paper we present our experiences and
               challenges in conducting several studies that evaluate
               interactive systems in difficult settings, from the perspective
               of the ethics process. Based on these, we draft recommendations
               for mitigating the effect of such challenges to the ethical
               conduct of research. We then issue a call for interaction
               researchers, together with policy makers, to refine existing
               ethics guidelines and protocols in order to more accurately
               capture the particularities of such field-based evaluations,

                 and even desirable mode for complex social surveys, but the
                 financial challenges faced by the Research Councils and the UK
                 Government has accelerated this shift, creating an urgent need
                 to explore both its potential and hazards for a range of
                 studies. While some progress in carrying out large-scale
                 complex social surveys on the web has been made, there is still
                 no consensus about how this can best be achieved while
                 maintaining population representativeness and preserving data
                 quality. To address this problem, the NCRM funded a network of
                 methodological innovation “Web Surveys for the General
                 Population: How, Why and When?” (also known by its acronym
                 GenPopWeb). A key objective of the network’s activities was to
                 review and synthesise existing knowledge about the use of
                 web-based data collection for general population samples and to
                 identify areas where new research is needed. In this report,
                 the authors provide a summary of the main issues identified by
                 the network (chapter 2), present the key barriers to using web
                 for surveys of the general population (chapter 3), propose a
                 research agenda for the social science community (chapter 4),
                 argue the case for a UK probability-based web panel (chapter

               Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) community. In this paper, we
               take stock of 18 years of CCI research by conducting a systematic
               literature study exploring how and to what extent ethics has been
               dealt with in the community's leading venues: the Interaction
               Design and Children (IDC) conference and the International
               Journal of Child-Computer Interaction (CCI). Searching all papers
               in the IDC conference proceedings and IJCCI, 157 papers were
               found that use the word stem 'ethic*'. Based on our analysis of
               these papers, our study demonstrates that while ethics is
               frequently mentioned, the literature remains underdeveloped in a
               number of areas including definition and theoretical basis, the
               reporting of formal ethical approval procedures, and the extent
               to which design and participation ethics is dealt with. Based on
               our study we provide five avenues of future research in the
               interests of developing a more explicit discourse on ethics in

                  discipline which occupies the ‘middle space’ between the
                  learning sciences/educational research, and the use of
                  computational techniques to capture and analyse data (Suthers
                  and Verbert, 2013). We propose that the literature examining
                  the triadic relationships between epistemology (the nature of
                  knowledge), pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching) and
                  assessment provide critical considerations for bounding this
                  middle space. We provide examples to illustrate the ways in
                  which the understandings of particular analytics are informed
                  by this triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might
                  design analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order
                  learning, we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs:
                  beliefs about the nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics
                  grounded in a pragmatic, sociocultural perspective are well
                  placed to explore this construct using discourse-centric
                  technologies. The examples provided throughout this paper,
                  through emphasising the consideration of intentional design
                  issues in the middle space, underscore the “interpretative
                  flexibility” (Hamilton \& Feenberg, 2005) of new technologies,

              Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study in a classroom equipped with computers,
              two of which were set up to allow human facilitators (wizards) to

              interaction with the environment. The wizards provided support
              using a script and following an iterative methodology that limited
              on purpose their communication capacity in order to simulate the
              actual system. Our results indicate that the feedback received
              from the wizards did serve its function i.e. it helped modify
              students' behaviour in that they did think-aloud significantly
              more than in past interactions and rephrased their language to
              employ mathematical terminology. Additional results from student
              perception questionnaires show that overall students find the

              Most also enjoy thinking aloud to the computer but, as expected,
              some find the feedback cognitively overloading, indicating that

                systems react to inappropriate requests, such as bullying and
                sexual harassment on the part of the user, by collecting and
                analysing the novel \#MeTooAlexa corpus. Our results show that
                commercial systems mainly avoid answering, while rulebased
                chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often deflect.
                Data-driven systems, on the other hand, are often non-coherent,
                but also run the risk of being interpreted as flirtatious and
                sometimes react with counter-aggression. This includes our own
                system, trained on “clean” data, which suggests that
                inappropriate system behaviour is not caused by data bias.},

               Education and Training (VET). In recent years many countries have
               developed a new interest in creating or strengthening the
               vocational part of the educational system, both at the basic and
               higher education level. These developments ask for a sound
               scientific underpinning of policy decisions and have therefore
               created a new need for empirically oriented academic research in
               VET issues. The new journal will address VET-specific questions
               from different academic disciplines emphasizing empirical work
               that fulfils highest methodological and statistical standards of
               research. The journal Empirical Research in Vocational Education
               and Training will follow developments throughout the world in
               vocational training institutions and companies. The journal
               welcomes comparative studies that allow to empirically compare
               the effectiveness, efficiency and equity in different VET systems
               at the school-, company and systemic level. The journal has the
               goal to cover a broad range of topics in the VET field from all
               relevant scientific disciplines. The journal has therefore an
               international pluridisciplinary editorial board and also an
               advisory board with leading international academics in the fields
               of pedagogy, psychology, sociology and economics. The targeted
               audience of the journal are academics and researchers in the
               field of VET. In addition the empirical orientation of the
               journal should make it and interesting source of information for
               policy-makers, policy planners and administrators, school-leaders
               and trainers in the field of VET. Empirical Research in
               Vocational Education and Training publishes empirical work in all
               fields of VET from basic VET to continuous or adult learning. All
               contributions are peer reviewed by at least 2 anonymous referees.

               BOOK OF THE YEARIn this ground-breaking blend of imaginative
               storytelling and scientific forecasting, a pioneering AI expert
               and a leading writer of speculative fiction join forces to answer
               an imperative question: How will artificial intelligence change
               our world within twenty years?AI will be the defining development
               of the twenty-first century. Within two decades, aspects of daily
               human life will be unrecognizable. AI will generate unprecedented
               wealth, revolutionize medicine and education through
               human-machine symbiosis, and create brand new forms of
               communication and entertainment. In liberating us from routine
               work, however, AI will also challenge the organizing principles
               of our economic and social order. Meanwhile, AI will bring new
               risks in the form of autonomous weapons and smart technology that
               inherits human bias. AI is at a tipping point, and people need to
               wake up-both to AI's radiant pathways and its existential perils
               for life as we know it. In this provocative, utterly original
               work of "scientific fiction," Kai-Fu Lee, the former president of
               Google China and bestselling author of AI Superpowers, joins
               forces with celebrated novelist Chen Qiufan to imagine our world
               in 2041 and how it will be shaped by AI. In ten gripping short
               stories, set twenty years in the future, they introduce readers
               to an array of eye-opening 2041 settings: In San Francisco, a new
               industry, "job reallocation," arises to serve displaced workers
               In Tokyo, a music fan is swept up in an immersive form of
               celebrity worship In Mumbai, a teenage girl rebels when AI gets
               in the way of romance In Seoul, virtual teachers offer orphaned
               twins new ways to learn and connect In Munich, a rogue quantum
               computer scientist's revenge plot imperils the world By gazing
               toward a not-so-distant horizon, AI 2041 offers urgent insights
               into our collective future-while reminding readers that,
               ultimately, humankind remains the author of its destiny.},

               the magnificent work it produces, helps demonstrates the
               worldwide impact of the industry. Chapter topics include The
               construction industry at large, the “players” in construction,
               the sequence of a project, and communications and documentation.
               Appendices cover: a narrative of a project sequence; the concept

                  distant object? Recent neurophysiological, psychological and
                  neuropsychological research suggests that this extended motor
                  capability is followed by changes in specific neural networks
                  that hold an updated map of body shape and posture (the
                  putative "Body Schema" of classical neurology). These changes
                  are compatible with the notion of the inclusion of tools in
                  the "Body Schema", as if our own effector (e.g. the hand) were
                  elongated to the tip of the tool. In this review we present
                  empirical support for this intriguing idea from both
                  single-neuron recordings in the monkey brain and behavioural
                  performance of normal and brain-damaged humans. These

                  fax machines in use, the less important it is to have one.
                  These network effects influence consumer decisions and affect
                  companies’ ability to compete. Strategists have developed some
                  well-known rules for navigating business environments with
                  network effects. “Move first” is one, and “get big fast” is
                  another. In a study of dozens of companies, however, the
                  authors found that quite often the conventional wisdom was
                  dead wrong. And when the rules failed, the reason was always
                  the same: Companies trip up when they try to attract large
                  volumes of customers without understanding (1) the strength of
                  mutual attraction among various customer groups and (2) the
                  extent of asymmetric attraction among them. Looking at
                  examples such as TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, and the New York
                  Times, the authors offer strategies for competing in markets
                  with network effects. New entrants should focus on customer
                  groups that they are uniquely positioned to serve or appeal to
                  the most attractive customers in a market. Incumbents pursuing
                  growth strategies in adjacent markets or new geographies
                  should consider how similar the needs of new customers are to
                  those of existing customers. Offering complements also allows
                  incumbents to reach additional customer groups.},

  abstract  = {What artificial intelligence can tell us about the mind and
               intelligent behavior.What can artificial intelligence teach us
               about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a
               computational process, then how can computation illuminate
               thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the
               buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer
               systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of
               data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this
               book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to “good old
               fashioned artificial intelligence,” which is based not on heaps
               of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind
               of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that
               depart from previous patterns—as we do in real life, when, for
               example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista
               informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
               of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that
               passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he
               proposes another way to test for intelligence—the Winograd Schema
               Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. “If our goal is
               to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the
               difference between making it and faking it,” he observes. He
               identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the
               capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to
               represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more
               and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without
               common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.},

  abstract  = {If you were accused of a crime, who would you rather decide your
               sentence--a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of
               empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and error?
               What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between
               one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that
               prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree
               to share your family's full medical history if you were told that
               it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?These are just
               some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach
               the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign
               supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to
               watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail.
               But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important
               decisions--in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and
               money--they raise questions about what we want our world to look
               like. What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or
               preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing
               innocent people being falsely accused? Hello World takes us on a
               tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the
               algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician
               Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how
               algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways
               in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By
               weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible
               explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms,
               Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their
               limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on
               the human systems they replace.},

  abstract  = {Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill,
               play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus
               intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as
               possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the
               people who got a head start. But if you take a closer look at the
               world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel
               laureates, you'll find that early specialization is the
               exception, not the rule. David Epstein, author of the New York
               Times bestseller The Sports Gene, studied the world's most
               successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters
               and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially
               those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not
               specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their
               path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on
               one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make
               connections their more specialized peers can't spy from deep in
               their hyperfocused trenches. As experts silo themselves further
               while computers master more of the skills once reserved for
               highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace
               diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.
               Our obsession with getting a head start is understandable; early
               specialization feels efficient. But Epstein marshals an enormous
               body of scientific research to argue that we should all actively
               cultivate inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn.
               Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The
               most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening
               their knowledge in a single area. Provocative, rigorous, and
               engrossing, Range explains how to maintain the benefits of
               breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and
               delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes,
               even demands, hyperspecialization.},

               rather than emotion to answer questions; and learning to unravel
               the world's secret codes. Now Levitt and Dubner have gathered up
               what they have learned and turned it into a readable and
               practical toolkit for thinking differently - thinking, that is,
               like a Freak. Whether you are interested in the best way to
               improve your odds in penalty kicks, or in major global reforms,
               here is a blueprint for an entirely new way to solve problems.
               Along the way, you'll learn how the techniques of a Japanese
               hot-dog-eating champion can help you, the reason an Australian
               doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, why Nigerian
               e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria, and
               why Van Halen's demanding tour contract banning brown M\&Ms was
               really a safety measure. You'll learn why sometimes it's best to
               put away your moral compass, and smarter to think like a child.
               You will be given a master class in incentives-because for better
               or worse, incentives rule our world. And you will learn to quit
               before you fail, because you can't solve tomorrow's problem if
               you aren't willing to abandon today's dud.Levitt and Dubner see

                  provided training in construction safety and their safety
                  knowledge was tested prior to the training, immediately
                  afterward, and one month later. Half of the subjects received
                  traditional classroom training with visual aids; the other
                  half were trained using a 3D immersive VR power-wall.
                  Significant advantage was found for VR training for stone
                  cladding work and for cast-in-situ concrete work, but not for
                  general site safety. VR training was more effective in terms
                  of maintaining trainees' attention and concentration. Training
                  with VR was more effective over time, especially in the
                  context of cast-in-situ concrete works. Given the need for
                  improved training and the advantages of training using VR,
                  incorporation of VR in construction safety training is
                  strongly recommended.},

                  plant and equipment, and safety training is considered by many
                  to be one of the best approaches to their prevention. However,
                  current safety training methods/tools are unable to provide
                  trainees with the hands-on practice needed. Game
                  technology-based safety training platforms have the potential
                  to overcome this problem in a virtual environment. One such
                  platform is described in this paper - its characteristics are
                  analysed and its possible contribution to safety training
                  identified. This is developed and tested by means of a case
                  study involving three major pieces of construction plant,

  abstract     = {Although augmented reality (AR) has gained much research
                  attention in recent years, the term AR was given different
                  meanings by varying researchers. In this article, we first
                  provide an overview of definitions, taxonomies, and
                  technologies of AR. We argue that viewing AR as a concept
                  rather than a type of technology would be more productive for
                  educators, researchers, and designers. Then we identify
                  certain features and affordances of AR systems and
                  applications. Yet, these compelling features may not be unique
                  to AR applications and can be found in other technological
                  systems or learning environments (e.g., ubiquitous and mobile
                  learning environments). The instructional approach adopted by
                  an AR system and the alignment among technology design,
                  instructional approach, and learning experiences may be more
                  important. Thus, we classify three categories of instructional
                  approaches that emphasize the “roles,” “tasks,” and
                  “locations,” and discuss what and how different categories of
                  AR approaches may help students learn. While AR offers new
                  learning opportunities, it also creates new challenges for
                  educators. We outline technological, pedagogical, learning
                  issues related to the implementation of AR in education. For
                  example, students in AR environments may be cognitively
                  overloaded by the large amount of information they encounter,
                  the multiple technological devices they are required to use,
                  and the complex tasks they have to complete. This article
                  provides possible solutions for some of the challenges and
                  suggests topics and issues for future research.},

                  attention by providing rich interaction in an environment
                  similar to the real world. User engagement duration is known
                  to increase in environments with intense interaction. However,
                  information in the literature about whether gender,
                  experience, or spatial ability affects interaction in these
                  environments is limited. In this study, these three factors
                  are compared to users' depth of interaction in a 3D virtual
                  world. In addition, the relationships between engagement
                  duration, spatial ability, and depth of interaction are
                  examined to investigate whether the first two factors can
                  predict the third. Findings showed that users' depth of
                  interaction was not influenced by gender, but experience and
                  spatial ability did affect interaction. A strong relationship
                  was determined between depth of interaction and engagement
                  duration, and a moderate relationship was found between depth
                  of interaction and spatial ability. Findings indicated that
                  when designing 3D environments, it is important to consider
                  which kinds of tasks provide more interaction and to what
                  extent spatial abilities affect interaction, as well as to

                the same time, a growing volume of research connects cognitive
                science theories with tangible/embodied interactions (TEI) and
                virtual reality (VR) to offer novel means to support spatial

                  guide, the purpose of this paper is to explore the
                  implications of considering the library as place, and
                  specifically as a place that has the “curious property of
                  being in relation with all the other sites, but in such a way
                  as to suspect, neutralize, or invent the set of relations that
                  they happen to designate, mirror, or reflect” (Foucault,
                  1986a, p. 24).Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws
                  upon a range of literary examples and from biographical
                  accounts of authors such as Alan Bennett, Michel Foucault, and
                  Umberto Eco to show how the library space operates as a
                  heterotopia.Findings– The paper finds that drawing together
                  the constructs of heterotopia and serendipity can enrich the
                  understanding of how libraries are experienced as sites of
                  play, creativity, and adventure.Originality/value– Foucault’s
                  concept of heterotopia is offered as an original and useful
                  frame that can account for the range of experiences and
                  associations uniquely attached to the library.},

               of creativity. Learn how: a slow hunch can be much more valuable
               than a Eureka moment; the connected 'hive mind' is smarter than
               the lone thinker; where you think matters just as much as what
               you're thinking; and, the best ideas come from building on the
               ideas and inventions of others. From the Renaissance to
               satellites, medical breakthroughs to social media, Charles Darwin
               to Marconi, Steven Johnson shows how, by recognising where and
               how patterns of creativity occur, we can all discover the secrets

               performance, while minimising economic cost and thus ensuring
               social accessibility. Across the UK, the construction industry is
               characterised by several regional differences, including the
               level of uptake of offsite production. If Scottish wood is
               produced through good silvicultural practices and is properly
               utilised in the construction sector, the import of raw material
               from other countries can be drastically reduced, with several
               advantages. In Scotland, innovation in the construction sector is
               often driven by large companies that can invest a quota of their
               turnover in research and development to create new products,
               experiment with new materials or develop more efficient methods
               of erection. The most significant drivers for offsite
               construction are considered by the Scottish respondents to be
               government policies, the housing shortage and environmental
               credentials, whereas less importance is attached to advanced

  abstract     = {Thanks to the increasing availability of consumer head-mounted
                  displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now
                  reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming
                  elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of
                  citizens could be a particularly promising domain for
                  immersive serious games, because people tend not to pay
                  attention to and benefit from current safety materials. In
                  this paper, we propose an HMD-based immersive game for
                  educating passengers about aviation safety that allows players
                  to experience a serious aircraft emergency with the goal of
                  surviving it. We compare the proposed approach to a
                  traditional aviation safety education method (the safety card)
                  used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for safety
                  knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing
                  learning immediately after the experience but we extend our
                  attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This
                  is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain
                  safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with
                  danger. A knowledge test administered before, immediately
                  after and one week after the experimental condition showed
                  that the immersive serious game was superior to the safety
                  card. Moreover, subjective as well as physiological
                  measurements employed in the study showed that the immersive
                  serious game was more engaging and fear-arousing than the
                  safety card, a factor that can contribute to explain the
                  obtained superior retention, as we discuss in the paper.},

               change in professional learning and as a (potential) enabler for
               new forms of learning. Changes in technology-enhanced
               professional learning are influenced by the inter-relationship of
               work practices, learning processes and technology systems. Based
               on an analysis of current research in professional learning with
               technologies, we identify a number of important trends. First,
               work practice tends to be agile and constantly changing so
               professionals are tending to use technologies to support
               just-in-time learning alongside formal professional training and
               education. Second, with widespread adoption of digital media in
               society, there appears to be increasing reliance on
               recommendations from AI systems for learning alongside guidance
               from workplace mentors or experts. Third, employers and employees
               want to find ways to extend assessment of formal educational
               qualifications through accreditation of the outcomes of informal,
               work-integrated learning. To shape the ongoing transformation of
               both work(places) and learning, the chapter highlights the ways
               diverse disciplines need to align reflectively, critically, and
               constructively to bring together theories and methods from
               learning sciences, computer science and human-computer
               interaction to identify problems and engineer solutions. Finally,
               we propose three constructs that are critical for
               technology-enhanced professional learning, but often are not
               taken into consideration: the goals and motivations of learners,
               the work environment and structure, and the tools and resources
               available for work and learning.},

                  some limited evidence linking imbalances in the existing
                  structure of craft training with skill shortages, the
                  incidence of unfilled vacancies was much more heavily related
                  to a failure to keep pace with the increased demand for a more
                  multi-skilled approach to training driven by the rise in
                  prefabricated building techniques within the industry.
                  However, it also found that a large scale shift towards
                  multi-skilled training might be costly as it would tend to

               training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to
               reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency.
               This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to
               present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the
               conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This
               updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and
               applications for ways to improve learning through personalization
               techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on
               evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory
               of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load
               which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological
               basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in
               learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to
               leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and
               learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's
               materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects,
               and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and
               students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional
               research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book
               distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for
               improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to

               communicating information effectively Use evidence-based

               ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines

               e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the
               classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among
               researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from
               research laboratories can inform the design and development of
               e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical
               journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning
               material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume
               and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning
               and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource
               for consumers and designers of multimedia learning.},

               science and built environment research through the process of
               testing the reliability and validity of their research outputs
               following the application of different methods of data
               collection. The book presents case studies that emphasize
               reliability and validity in different examples of qualitative,
               quantitative and mixed method data sets, as well as covering
               action research and grounded theory. The reader is guided through
               case studies that demonstrate: An understanding of the
               reliability and validity approaches from social science and built
               environment perspectives in alignment with the relevant research
               philosophies, approaches and data collection strategies Real
               research projects that have been conducted by expert researchers
               on topics such as Lean, BIM, Housing and Sustainability to answer
               specific or evolving questions in relation to the reliability and
               validity of research A simple and easy method that students at
               Masters and PhD levels can relate to in order to adopt a sound
               reliability and validity approach to their research This book is
               the essential guide for researchers at undergraduate and
               postgraduate level who need to understand how to validate the
               quality of the empirical tests they conduct using different
               techniques. The book will also be a great asset to supervisors
               from different backgrounds who need a refresher on this key

  abstract  = {The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research
               methodology head on and is an essential read for anyone with an
               interest in this field.},

               industrial building and planning from the end of the nineteenth
               century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Drawing on
               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this
               collection of essays highlights key moments in industrial
               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms

               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry

                  material, with three tonnes per year used for every person in
                  the world. Twice as much concrete is used in construction as
                  all other building materials combined. There is little doubt
                  that concrete will remain in use as a construction material
                  well into the future. However, with such extensive use of the
                  material, discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated

                  matter of considerable public concern – both from a safety
                  perspective and associated costs of rectification.
                  Accordingly, this paper will initially review the historic
                  development of cements and concrete and will then focus on the
                  mechanical response of concrete and reinforced concrete to its

               function for the development of the firm and, therefore,
               psychological concepts have become more and more important to
               enable us to understand entrepreneurship. A general model is
               presented which argues that personality and human capital
               (education, experience) factors have a function via goals and
               action strategies on success. The same is also true of the
               environment. In earlier times, personality factors were
               emphasized by psychological researchers on entrepreneurship.
               There are good reasons to do this; however, modern research goes
               beyond this and differentiates more sharply between emergence of
               firms and firm success, and looks in more detail at contingencies
               between person and environmental factors. The actions of the
               entrepreneur are crucial for the firm's chances to survive and
               thrive in the market. All those psychological constructs that are
               near to actions—for example, goals and strategies—have an
               important effect on the functioning of the start-up firm.},

               in the Virginia Community College System in Fall 2004 using a
               classic Mincerian approach. Consistent with previous studies, we
               find positive returns to college-level credits, even among

               earning that degree—associated with associate and bachelor’s

                  figures. These hypotheses were partially supported. On the
                  global task, the dyslexia group was faster but no more
                  accurate than the control group at identifying impossible
                  objects. On the feature-oriented task, the control group
                  outperformed the dyslexia group. The results indicate that the

               Education critically analyses the specific challenges relating to
               teacher educators in the English further education (FE), such as
               the diverse nature of learners and the variety of educational
               contexts. It focuses on the journeys to becoming teacher
               educators, their relevant teaching know-how and professional
               needs. This book combines theoretical frameworks with both
               qualitative and quantitative data to outline the pathways,
               professional identities, knowledge, and continuous professional
               development of teacher educators. This data is used to discuss
               the four main themes. The first deals with the teacher educators’
               initial disciplinary areas, journey-making to be educators, and
               the current titles/positions. The next one delineates the
               know-how (knowledge, experiences, capacities and skill sets) to
               perform as teacher educators. The third one relates to their
               professional identities and the final topic, their professional
               requirements as FE teacher educators. Contributing to the field
               of further and vocational education, this book will be of great
               interest for researchers, academics, and postgraduate students in
               the field of education, specifically FE and teacher educators.},

               Education explores how practitioners in a variety of occupations
               perform their jobs and argues that working and learning are
               intricately connected. Drawing on theories around working and
               learning in informal, formal and lifelong settings, the book
               gives insights into how workers negotiate their occupational
               practices. The book investigates four related concepts – informal
               learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education and
               epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories and
               empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual framework
               of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and skill sets
               play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case studies of
               professions ranging from conventional occupations of acting,
               detective work, international road transportation to emerging
               professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional therapy and
               opinion leadership. This book will be of great interest for

               business, medicine, education, government—and the quality of our
               livesToday, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the belief
               that the path to success is quantifying human performance,
               publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the
               numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with
               scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to
               fixating on measuring itself—and this tyranny of metrics now
               threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this
               brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the
               damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the
               problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education,
               government, and other fields, the book explains why paying for
               measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may
               increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when
               used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience,
               metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable
               checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential
               corrective to a harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.},

  abstract  = {Sweden remained neutral in both wars, leaving the industrial
               infrastructure intact, and directly after the end of World War
               II, the first national building code was issued. Between 1965 and
               1975, Sweden produced a million dwellings as a result of a
               political initiative, bringing to an end the 50-year-long housing
               shortage. In 1994, the government removed all subsidiaries to
               housing construction in Sweden and for the first time in 70
               years, the housing market was governed by market forces only. The
               development of offsite construction was technology driven in
               Sweden up until 1970. When venturing into offsite construction,
               there are investments. These investments are commonly in
               production equipment and even factories, but also in personnel,
               training, and the supply chain. The lean operations strategy was
               originally developed to enable the production of high-quality
               goods with a small amount of resources in a short amount of time.},

               prefabricated and modular building, in particular housing, and
               even more so the individual detached house. The ‘prefab’ house
               combines the promise of industrialised building with the dream of
               a popular mass market for architecture, and it has exercised a
               magnetism over architectural culture which is as strong today as
               it was at any point in the past. The interest originated in the
               mid-nineteenth century, but achieved a strong uptake in the early
               to mid-twentieth century, and has continued in a cyclical pattern
               up to the present day. This chapter describes this fascination
               with the prefab house and discusses some of the complications
               that have plagued its translation into real outcomes. As the
               history of twentieth-century architect-led prefabricated housing

               information modeling has stimulated the popularity of
               prefabrication methods, the industry remains reluctant to adopt
               methods of prefabrication. One explanation is that there is
               little substantial quantifiable data to support the benefits of
               prefabrication in construction delivery. To enumerate the claims
               of prefabrication performance, there have been efforts to conduct
               industry-wide surveys and reports. The chapter presents an

               the concept of montage as a driver for establishing a new
               perspective on industrially based construction. Montage holds the
               potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in

               engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site

               speed versus accuracy: developments in the realm of building
               construction are frequently explained through dichotomies.
               Creating architectural dialogues between new and old, industrial
               and traditional, could provide possible answers to the latent
               industrial-oriented problems of monotonous repetition, weak

               surfaces. The inherent differences between industrial and

               construction waste for a prefabricated building is typically less
               than that of conventional construction. This is largely due to
               efficient procurement processes, the convenience of recycling

               conveniently reuse some ‘waste’ material in the next project
               going down the line. Onsite homebuilders typically order
               materials and products as needed for one building at a time, and

               even overbuilt; steel frames are used in 80 percent of

               cost-effective, higher-quality, and faster-to-market solution
               than traditional stick-built construction. The added value of
               PMC, although conceptually strong, has yet to be significantly
               substantiated. The study quantifies the added value of PMC and
               evaluates the contextual factors by which PMC in building design
               and construction may be realized in North America and beyond. The
               data from the PMC projects was compared to benchmark projects
               developed by Cumming Corporation, a cost consultancy firm. It is
               important to note that most stakeholders reported PMC offers a
               greater control of cost compared to traditional build. This is
               attributed to the inherent ability to reduce the number of change
               orders in any given PMC project. The most significant benefit of
               PMC is its ability to be completed with reduction in schedule.

                the way individuals justify their actions to others,
                instinctively drawing on their experience to appeal to
                principles they hope will command respect. Individuals, however,
                often misread situations, and many disagreements can be
                explained by people appealing, knowingly and unknowingly, to
                different principles. On Justification is the first English
                translation of Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's ambitious
                theoretical examination of these phenomena, a book that has
                already had a huge impact on French sociology and is likely to
                have a similar influence in the English-speaking world. In this
                foundational work of post-Bourdieu sociology, the authors
                examine a wide range of situations where people justify their
                actions. The authors argue that justifications fall into six
                main logics exemplified by six authors: civic (Rousseau), market
                (Adam Smith), industrial (Saint-Simon), domestic (Bossuet),
                inspiration (Augustine), and fame (Hobbes). The authors show how
                these justifications conflict, as people compete to legitimize
                their views of a situation.On Justification is likely to spark
                important debates across the social sciences.},

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new

               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new

               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you’re convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a rigorously
               researched but counterintuitive model of market activity that
               emphasizes what people designing products or launching startups
               soon discover—the inherent difficulties of connecting individuals
               to things. Callon’s model is founded upon the notion of
               “singularization,” the premise that goods and services must adapt
               and be adapted to the local milieu of every individual whose life
               they enter. Person by person, thing by thing, Callon demonstrates
               that for ordinary economic transactions to emerge en masse,
               singular connections must be made.Pushing us to see markets as
               more than abstract interfaces where pools of anonymous buyers and
               sellers meet, Callon draws our attention to the exhaustively
               creative practices that market professionals continuously devise
               to entangle people and things. Markets in the Making exemplifies
               how prototypes, fragile curiosities that have only just been
               imagined, are gradually honed into predictable objects and
               practices. Once these are active enough to create a desired
               effect, yet passive enough to be transferred from one place to
               another without disruption, they will have successfully achieved
               the status of “goods” or “services.” The output of this more
               ample process of innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we
               recognize as “the market”—commercial activity, at scale.The
               capstone of an influential research career at the forefront of
               science and technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently
               integrates the empirical perspective of product engineering with
               the values of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing
               how markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.},

               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and
               ‘communities of practice’ external to the workplace.},

                  few people understand what personalized learning really means

                  learning environment appropriate for all learners, especially
                  learners with disabilities. This 18-month descriptive research
                  study focused on identifying the design characteristics of
                  personalized learning environments and the initial results of
                  these environments. Findings indicate that personalized
                  learning environments require more than technology, that the
                  technology itself is simply a tool to support implementation.

               which underlie recent research in machine intelligence. Lucy
               Suchman argues that the planning model of interaction favoured by
               the majority of AI researchers does not take sufficient account
               of the situatedness of most human social behaviour. The problems
               that can arise as a result are pertinently, and often amusingly,
               illustrated by the careful analysis of a recorded interaction
               between novice users and an intelligent machine, whose design has
               failed to accommodate essential resources of successful human
               communication. Plans and Situated Actions presents a compelling
               case for the re-examination of current models underlying
               interface design. Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh
               characterisation of human-computer interaction which also
               incorporates recent insights from the social sciences provides a
               challenge that everyone interested in machine intelligence will

               crises, the policies that could fix them and the politics

               or, more accurately, multiple housing crises. A massive housing
               shortage in major cities has resulted in skyrocketing rents. Low-
               and middle-income individuals find themselves priced out of the
               places with the most opportunity. Homelessness is rampant in
               cities across the country. Developers often face the steepest
               obstacles to building in the places where new housing is needed
               most. And young people are increasingly viewing homeownership,
               once a vital part of the American dream, as hopelessly out of
               reach. These outcomes weren’t inevitable. Plenty of other
               countries supply their populations with high-quality housing at
               lower prices. And the solutions here are incredibly simple: Build
               more housing in places where it’s needed, build cheaper forms of
               housing, build housing alongside public transit, provide more
               housing vouchers. So why don’t we act on them?},

               responsivity of vocational education. Responsivity is defined as
               the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to
               interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for
               curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach.
               VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and
               confidence to engage in work and make a difference in the
               transformation of work. This chapter argues that learners have to
               be provided with opportunities to actively engage in innovation
               at work to experience what is needed to deal with uncertainty and
               to organize their own learning in such circumstances. In the
               Netherlands, the challenges of building regional networks and
               participating in regional innovation are being taken up by higher
               professional education (HPE). This chapter describes the
               promising approach developed in the Netherlands, which focuses on
               innovative work-based learning to strengthen responsivity.},

               Director of the Postgraduate Diploma and MA in Theatre
               Consultancy), this new publication is written by a team of
               international experts, architects, theatre consultants,
               acousticians, engineers and industry professionals led by Tim
               Foster (Foster Wilson Size) and Robin Townley (CEO of the ABTT).
               It provides an invaluable resource for those looking to build,
               remodel or conserve theatre buildings, taking into account the
               significant changes which have taken place in the last twelve
               years in all aspects of theatre design and technical practice. It
               locates those changes in the wider context of the need for
               sustainability in the theatre industry in response to the climate
               emergency, inclusivity, diversity of access, placemaking and
               concerns for health and wellbeing. This new edition provides
               guidance for anyone who seeks inspiration and encouragement to
               create or improve a place of entertainment or who seeks to
               understand what might be required to accommodate an audience for
               the presentation of live performance and the successful use,
               operation and organisation of such a venue. Its generous format
               and the thirty-two new reference projects, more than 260
               high-resolution colour images and 175 diagrams and specially
               commissioned plans make it accessible and informative both to the
               general reader and the professional specialist.},

               readers with a set of ideas that will enrich their conversation,
               their writing, and above all their thinking about architecture.

               particular aspect of architecture, and introduces difficult
               concepts gradually. Architectural theorists and philosophers are
               mentioned in passing and their works are listed in the

               of particular theorists. Written in a conversational style,
               Thinking about Architecture is an invaluable and accessible

               investigation should also apply to politics. In a new foreword,

               event with three principal characteristics - It is unpredictable;
               it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an
               explanation that makes it appear less random, and more
               predictable, than it was. Why do we not acknowledge the
               phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the
               answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn
               specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We
               concentrate on things we already know and time and time again
               fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are,
               therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable
               to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open
               enough to rewarding those who can imagine the 'impossible'.},

               feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual
               world where most of humanity spends their days. When the

               decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his

               widespread. However, countries vary widely in strategies for
               strengthening jobs at intermediate levels of skill. This paper
               examines the role of apprenticeship in training and upgrading for
               middle-level occupations. The first section defines and describes
               middle-skills occupations, largely in terms of education and
               experience. The next step is to examine skill requirements and
               alternative approaches to preparing and upgrading the skills of
               individuals for these occupations. Programs of academic education
               and apprenticeship programs emphasizing work-based learning have
               often competed for the same space but with significant
               complementarities. Third, we consider the evidence on the costs
               and effectiveness of apprenticeship training in several countries
               from the employer, worker, and government perspectives. The final
               section highlights the advantages of apprenticeship training for
               intermediate level skills, jobs, and careers.},

  abstract     = {As Everett Hughes noted, there is an “underside” to all work.
                  Each job includes ways of doing things that would be
                  inappropriate for those outside the guild to know. Illusions
                  are essential for maintaining occupational reputation, but in
                  the process they create a set of moral dilemmas. So it is with
                  ethnographic work. This article describes the underside of
                  ethnographic work: compromises that one frequently makes with
                  idealized ethical standards. It argues that images of
                  ethnographers—personal and public—are based on partial truths
                  or self-deceptions. The focus is on three clusters of
                  dilemmas: the classical virtues (the kindly ethnographer, the
                  friendly ethnographer, and the honest ethnographer), technical
                  skills (the precise ethnographer, the observant ethnographer,
                  and the unobtrusive ethnographer), and the ethnographic self
                  (the candid ethnographer, the chaste ethnographer, the fair
                  ethnographer, and the literary ethnographer). Changes in
                  ethnographic styles and traditions alter the balance of these
                  deceptions but do not eliminate the need for methodological
                  illusions.},

               outstanding examples. Current planning and design modes of
               dwellings and neighborhoods are facing challenges of philosophy
               and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and
               require innovative thinking. The need for a new outlook is
               propelled by fundamental changes that touch upon environmental,
               economic and social aspects. The depletion of non-renewable
               natural resources and climate change are a few of the
               environmental challenges. Increasing costs of material, labor,
               land and infrastructure have posed economic challenges with
               affordability being paramount among them. Social challenges are
               also drawing the attention of designers, builders and homeowners.
               Walkable communities, aging in place and multigenerational living
               are some of the concepts considered. In addition, live-work
               environments have become part of the economic reality for those
               who wish to work from home—which has become possible through
               digital advances.},

               advantage. Performance gains can be achieved through cost saving,
               process improvement or technology adoption, but the biggest
               difference is made by people. This means that recruiting,
               engaging and retaining the very best talent has never been more
               important.Crucially, these employees should be a diverse group of
               people with different approaches, skills and strengths in
               problem-solving and driving innovation. As well as focusing on
               gender, race, age and class, it is critical that businesses also
               develop a neurodiverse workforce if they are committed to
               outperforming the competition and achieving sustainable business
               growth.Neurodiversity at Work is a practical guide that explains
               what neurodiversity is, why it's important and what the benefits
               are. It covers how to attract, recruit and engage neurodiverse
               talent and provides guidance on how to adapt HR policies,
               processes and workplaces to ensure that all employees, including
               the 2 in 10 employees in the UK who are neurodiverse, can reach
               their full potential. Neurodiversity at Work is packed full of
               case studies from leading organizations like Microsoft who are
               already seeing the productivity, performance and financial
               benefits of neurodiversity in the workplace. Individuals in these
               companies are also experiencing benefits in their working
               environments. Also featured are interviews with prominent figures
               in the neurodiversity community and people who have successfully
               adapted their HR processes for neurodiversity, including members
               of the ND@IBM Program and the Head of People and Culture at
               Autotrader. With tips, advice, examples and 'how to' actions in

               reveal our priorities and ambitions, our family structures and
               power structures. And to an extent never explored until now,
               architecture has been shaped in every era by our access to
               energy, from fire to farming to fossil fuels.In this
               ground-breaking history of world architecture, Barnabas Calder
               takes us on a dazzling tour of some of the most astonishing
               buildings of the past fifteen thousand years, from Uruk, via
               Ancient Rome and Victorian Liverpool, to China's booming
               megacities. He reveals how every building - from the Parthenon to
               the Great Mosque of Damascus to a typical Georgian house - was
               influenced by the energy available to its architects, and why
               this matters.Today architecture consumes so much energy that 40\%
               of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from the
               construction and running of buildings. If we are to avoid
               catastrophic climate change then now, more than ever, we need
               beautiful but also intelligent architecture, and to retrofit -
               not demolish - the buildings we already have.},

               academic, capped by sharing the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics
               and the Nobel Peace Prize, and honorary degrees from Harvard,
               Cambridge, Oxford and more than fifty other universities, and
               elected not only to the National Academy of Sciences and the
               American Academy of Arts and Letters but the Royal Society and
               the British Academy; a public servant, who served as Chair of
               President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and Chief
               Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank, headed
               international commissions for the UN and France, and was awarded
               the French Legion of Honor and Australia's Sydney Peace Prize; a
               public intellectual whose numerous books on vital topics have
               been best sellers. What brought him to economics were his
               concerns about the inequality and discrimination he saw growing
               up. Wanting to understand what drives it and what can be done
               about it has been his lifelong passion. This book gathers
               together and extends to new frontiers this lifelong work, drawing
               upon the challenges and insights of each of these phases of his
               career. In a still very widely cited paper written fifty years
               ago, Stiglitz set forth the fundamental framework for analyzing
               intergenerational transfer of wealth and advantage, which plays a
               central role in persistent inequality. That and subsequent work,
               developed most fully here for the first time, described today's
               inequality as a result of centrifugal forces increasing
               inequality and centripetal forces reducing it. In recent decades,
               the centrifugal forces have strengthened, the centripetal forces
               weakened. His general theory provides a framework for
               understanding the marked growth in inequality in recent decades,
               and for devising policies to reduce it. A central message is that
               ever-increasing inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is, in a
               fundamental sense, a choice. Stiglitz explains that inequality
               does not largely arise from differences in savings rates between
               capitalists and others, though that may play a role (as Piketty,
               Marx, and Kaldor suggest); but rather, it originates importantly
               from the rules of the game, which have weakened the bargaining
               power of workers as they have increased the market power of
               corporations. He also explains how monetary authorities have
               contributed to increasing wealth inequality, and how, unless
               something is done about it, likely changes in technology such as
               AI and robotization will make matters worse. He describes
               policies that can simultaneously reduce inequality and improve
               economic performance.},

               more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two

               members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues - this
               is the acclaimed, internationally bestselling biography of the
               ultimate icon of inventiveness. Walter Isaacson tells the story
               of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of
               creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious
               drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated
               movies,music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing.

               over what was written, nor even the right to read it before it
               was published. He put nothing off limits. He encouraged the

               sometimes brutally so, about the people he worked with and
               competed against. His friends, foes, and colleagues provide an
               unvarnished view of the passions, perfectionism, obsessions,
               artistry, devilry, and compulsion for control that shaped his
               approach to business and the innovative products that resulted.},

                  Production Planning and Scheduling (PPS) considers a wide
                  range of internal and external factors in its attempts to
                  align production with market demand. Advanced Planning and

                  uncertainties. Expectations are high that Artificial

               What if you stopped trying to do everything, so that you could
               finally get round to what counts?We're obsessed with our
               lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle
               against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are
               shrivelling. Still, we rarely make the connection between our
               daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management
               problem: the question of how best to use our ridiculously brief
               time on the planet, which amounts on average to about four
               thousand weeks. Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting, engrossing
               and deeply realistic exploration of the challenge. Rejecting the
               futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' it
               introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by
               embracing rather than denying their limitations. And it shows how
               the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't
               inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made, as
               individuals and as a society. Its many revelations will transform
               the reader's worldview. Drawing on the insights of both ancient
               and contemporary philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual
               teachers, Oliver Burkeman sets out to realign our relationship
               with time - and in doing so, to liberate us from its
               tyranny.Embrace your limits. Change your life. Make your four
               thousand weeks count.},

               at the construction site. Modularization is a philosophy change!
               And along with that change, comes the need to understand the
               implementation requirements and project mindset adjustments that
               impact and influence all aspects of the modular project. To

               modular project unique, starting with the very basics in terms of
               definitions and setting the groundwork of expectations by
               identifying benefits and challenges. Then, because the journey is
               as important as the destination, the reader is guided through the
               various project phases in a manner that reflects how they would
               be addressed in the workplace. From the very earliest

               protects all the others,” as Lyndon Johnson famously said when he
               signed the Voting Rights Act—but it’s also the one most violently
               contested throughout U.S. history. Since the gutting of the act
               in the landmark Shelby County v. Holder case in 2013, many states
               have passed laws restricting the vote. After the 2020 election,
               President Trump’s effort to overturn the vote has evolved into a
               slow-motion coup, with many Republicans launching an all-out
               assault on our democracy. The vote seems to be in unprecedented
               peril. But the peril is not at all unprecedented. America is a
               fragile democracy, Eric Holder argues, whose citizens have only
               had unfettered access to the ballot since the 1960s. He takes
               readers through three dramatic stories of how the vote was won:
               first by white men, through violence and insurrection; then by
               white women, through protests and mass imprisonments; and finally
               by African Americans, in the face of lynchings and terrorism.
               Next, he dives into how the vote has been stripped away since
               Shelby—a case in which Holder was one of the parties. He ends
               with visionary chapters on how we can reverse this tide of voter
               suppression and become a true democracy where every voice is
               heard and every vote is counted.},

  abstract  = {In How Progress Ends, Carl Benedikt Frey challenges the
               conventional belief that economic and technological progress is
               inevitable. For most of human history, stagnation was the norm,
               and even today progress and prosperity in the world’s largest,
               most advanced economies—the United States and China—have fallen
               short of expectations. To appreciate why we cannot depend on any
               AI-fueled great leap forward, Frey offers a remarkable and
               fascinating journey across the globe, spanning the past 1,000
               years, to explain why some societies flourish and others fail in
               the wake of rapid technological change. By examining key
               historical moments—from the rise of the steam engine to the dawn
               of AI—Frey shows why technological shifts have shaped, and
               sometimes destabilized, entire civilizations. He explores why
               some leading technological powers of the past—such as Song China,
               the Dutch Republic, and Victorian Britain—ultimately lost their
               innovative edge, why some modern nations such as Japan had
               periods of rapid growth followed by stagnation, and why planned
               economies like the Soviet Union collapsed after brief surges of
               progress. Frey uncovers a recurring tension in history: while
               decentralization fosters the exploration of new technologies,
               bureaucracy is crucial for scaling them. When institutions fail
               to adapt to technological change, stagnation inevitably follows.
               Only by carefully balancing decentralization and bureaucracy can
               nations innovate and grow over the long term—findings that have
               worrying implications for the United States, Europe, China, and
               other economies today. Through a rich narrative that weaves
               together history, economics, and technology, How Progress Ends
               reveals that managing the future requires us to draw the right
               lessons from the past.},

  abstract  = {Rifkin uncovers a paradox at the heart of capitalism that has
               propelled it to greatness but is now taking it to its death—the
               inherent entrepreneurial dynamism of competitive markets that
               drives productivity up and marginal costs down, enabling
               businesses to reduce the price of their goods and services in
               order to win over consumers and market share. (Marginal cost is
               the cost of producing additional units of a good or service, if
               fixed costs are not counted.) While economists have always
               welcomed a reduction in marginal cost, they never anticipated the
               possibility of a technological revolution that might bring
               marginal costs to near zero, making goods and services priceless,
               nearly free, and abundant, and no longer subject to market
               forces. Now, a formidable new technology infrastructure—the
               Internet of things (IoT)—is emerging with the potential of
               pushing large segments of economic life to near zero marginal
               cost in the years ahead. Rifkin describes how the Communication
               Internet is converging with a nascent Energy Internet and
               Logistics Internet to create a new technology platform that
               connects everything and everyone. Billions of sensors are being
               attached to natural resources, production lines, the electricity
               grid, logistics networks, recycling flows, and implanted in
               homes, offices, stores, vehicles, and even human beings, feeding
               Big Data into an IoT global neural network. Prosumers can connect
               to the network and use Big Data, analytics, and algorithms to
               accelerate efficiency, dramatically increase productivity, and
               lower the marginal cost of producing and sharing a wide range of
               products and services to near zero, just like they now do with
               information goods. The plummeting of marginal costs is spawning a
               hybrid economy—part capitalist market and part Collaborative
               Commons—with far reaching implications for society, according to
               Rifkin. Hundreds of millions of people are already transferring
               parts of their economic lives to the global Collaborative
               Commons. Prosumers are plugging into the fledgling IoT and making
               and sharing their own information, entertainment, green energy,
               and 3D-printed products at near zero marginal cost. They are also
               sharing cars, homes, clothes and other items via social media
               sites, rentals, redistribution clubs, and cooperatives at low or
               near zero marginal cost. Students are enrolling in free massive
               open online courses (MOOCs) that operate at near zero marginal
               cost. Social entrepreneurs are even bypassing the banking
               establishment and using crowdfunding to finance startup
               businesses as well as creating alternative currencies in the
               fledgling sharing economy. In this new world, social capital is
               as important as financial capital, access trumps ownership,
               sustainability supersedes consumerism, cooperation ousts
               competition, and "exchange value" in the capitalist marketplace
               is increasingly replaced by "sharable value" on the Collaborative
               Commons. Rifkin concludes that capitalism will remain with us,
               albeit in an increasingly streamlined role, primarily as an
               aggregator of network services and solutions, allowing it to
               flourish as a powerful niche player in the coming era. We are,
               however, says Rifkin, entering a world beyond markets where we
               are learning how to live together in an increasingly
               interdependent global Collaborative Commons.},

               Times'Deep work' is the ability to focus without distraction on a
               cognitively demanding task. Coined by author and professor Cal
               Newport on his popular blog Study Hacks, deep work will make you
               better at what you do, let you achieve more in less time and
               provide the sense of true fulfilment that comes from the mastery
               of a skill. In short, deep work is like a superpower in our
               increasingly competitive economy.And yet most people, whether
               knowledge workers in noisy open-plan offices or creatives
               struggling to sharpen their vision, have lost the ability to go
               deep - spending their days instead in a frantic blur of email and
               social media, not even realising there's a better way.A mix of

               building a stone tower in the woods to focus his mind, to a
               social media pioneer buying a round-trip business class ticket to
               Tokyo to write a book free from distraction in the air -- and
               surprising suggestions, such as the claim that most serious
               professionals should quit social media and that you should
               practice being bored. Put simply: developing and cultivating a
               deep work practice is one of the best decisions you can make in
               an increasingly distracted world. This book will point the way.},

               conventional wisdom by suggesting that it should be a person's
               talent and skill - and not necessarily their passion - that
               determines their career path. Newport, who graduated from
               Dartmouth College (Phi Beta Kappa) and earned a PhD. from MIT,
               contends that trying to find what drives us, instead of focusing
               on areas in which we naturally excel, is ultimately harmful and
               frustrating to job seekers.The title is a direct quote from
               comedian Steve Martin who, when once asked why he was successful
               in his career, immediately replied: "Be so good they can't ignore
               you" and that's the main basis for Newport's book. Skill and
               ability trump passion. Inspired by former Apple CEO Steve Jobs'
               famous Stanford University commencement speech in which Jobs
               urges idealistic grads to chase their dreams, Newport takes issue
               with that advice, claiming that not only is thsi advice
               Pollyannish, but that Jobs himself never followed his own
               advice.From there, Newport presents compelling scientific and
               contemporary case study evidence that the key to one's career
               success is to find out what you do well, where you have built up
               your 'career capital,' and then to put all of your efforts into

                  technologies, capital, and the wage structure motivates this
                  study of the origins of technology-skill complementarity in
                  manufacturing. We offer evidence of the existence of
                  technology-skill and capital-skill (relative)
                  complementarities from 1909 to 1929, and suggest that they
                  were associated with continuous-process and batch methods and
                  the adoption of electric motors. Industries that used more
                  capital per worker and a greater proportion of their
                  horsepower in the form of purchased electricity employed
                  relatively more educated blue-collar workers in 1940 and paid
                  their blue-collar workers substantially more from 1909 to
                  1929. We also infer capital-skill complementarity using the
                  wage-bill for non-production workers and find that the
                  relationship was as large from 1909-19 as it has been
                  recently. Finally, we link our findings to those on the
                  high-school movement (1910 to 1940). The rapid increase in the
                  supply of skills from 1910 to 1940 may have prevented rising
                  inequality with technological change.},

  abstract  = {In this groundbreaking book, Chris Anderson shows that the future
               of business does not lie in hits—the high-volume end of a
               traditional demand curve—but in what used to be regarded as
               misses—the endlessly long tail of that same curve. As our world
               is transformed by the Internet and the near-infinite choice it
               offers consumers, so traditional business models are being
               overturned and new truths revealed about what consumers want and
               how they want to get it. Chris Anderson first explored the Long
               Tail in an article in Wired magazine that has become one of the
               most influential business essays of our time. Now, in this
               eagerly anticipated book, he takes a closer look at the new
               economics of the Internet age, showing where business is going
               and exploring the huge opportunities that exist for new
               producers, new e-tailers, and new tastemakers. He demonstrates
               how long-tail economics apply to industries ranging from the toy
               business to advertising to kitchen appliances. He sets down the
               rules for operating in a long-tail economy. And he provides a
               glimpse of a future that's already here.},

  abstract  = {If a country wants to remain economically vibrant, it needs to
               manufacture things. In recent years, however, many nations have
               become obsessed with making money out of selling services,
               leaving the real business of manufacturing to others. Makers is
               about how all that is being reversed. Over the past ten years,
               the internet has democratized publishing, broadcasting, and
               communications, leading to a massive increase in the range of
               participation in everything digital—the world of bits. Now the
               same is happening to manufacturing—the world of things. Chris
               Anderson, bestselling author of The Long Tail, explains how this
               is happening: how such technologies as 3D printing and
               electronics assembly are becoming available to everybody, and how
               people are building successful businesses as a result. Whereas
               once every aspiring entrepreneur needed the support of a major
               manufacturer, now anybody with a smart idea and a little
               expertise can make their ideas a reality. Just as Google,
               Facebook, and others have created highly successful companies in
               the virtual world, so these new inventors and manufacturers are
               assuming positions of ever greater importance in the real world.
               The next industrial revolution is on its way.},

  abstract  = {Why do we use eighty-year-old metrics to understand today's
               economy? The ways that statisticians and governments measure the
               economy were developed in the 1940s, when the urgent economic
               problems were entirely different from those of today. In The
               Measure of Progress, Diane Coyle argues that the framework
               underpinning today's economic statistics is so outdated that it
               functions as a distorting lens, or even a set of blinkers. When
               policymakers rely on such an antiquated conceptual tool, how can
               they measure, understand, and respond with any precision to what
               is happening in today's digital economy? Coyle makes the case for
               a new framework, one that takes into consideration current
               economic realities. Coyle explains why economic statistics
               matter. They are essential for guiding better economic policies;
               they involve questions of freedom, justice, life, and death.
               Governments use statistics that affect people's lives in ways
               large and small. The metrics for economic growth were developed
               when a lack of physical rather than natural capital was the
               binding constraint on growth, intangible value was less
               important, and the pressing economic policy challenge was
               managing demand rather than supply. Today's challenges are
               different. Growth in living standards in rich economies has
               slowed, despite remarkable innovation, particularly in digital
               technologies. As a result, politics is contentious and democracy
               strained. Coyle argues that to understand the current economy, we
               need different data collected in a different framework of
               categories and definitions, and she offers some suggestions about
               what this would entail. Only with a new approach to measurement
               will we be able to achieve the right kind of growth for the
               benefit of all.},

               project “Desire - Designing the Irresistible Circular Society",
               weaving a narrative of transformative change. The book emphasizes
               innovative strategies, citizen engagement, and transdisciplinary
               approaches in shaping urban environments. The journey begins with
               an in-depth exploration of the Desire project, providing a
               nuanced understanding of the broader context of its experiments
               and research activities. This foundation leads to an examination
               of diverse approaches to achieving sustainable, inclusive, and
               aesthetically enriching urban transformations. Readers are guided
               through the complexities of urban change, gaining a holistic
               understanding of how urban transformation and an irresistible
               circular society can be cultivated and sustained within the

               Nearly Everything" is his quest to find out everything that has
               happened from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization—how we got
               from there, being nothing at all, to here, being us. Bill
               Bryson's challenge is to take subjects that normally bore the
               pants off most of us, like geology, chemistry, and particle
               physics, and see if there isn't some way to render them
               comprehensible to people who have never thought they could be
               interested in science. It's not so much about what we know, as
               about how we know what we know. How do we know what is in the
               center of the Earth, or what a black hole is, or where the
               continents were 600 million years ago? How did anyone ever figure
               these things out? On his travels through time and space, he

               painfully shy Henry Cavendish, who worked out many conundrums,
               like how much the Earth weighed, but never bothered to tell
               anybody about many of his findings. In the company of such
               extraordinary people, Bill Bryson takes us with him on the
               ultimate eye-opening journey, and reveals the world in a way most

               increased inequality. Drawing on more than a decade of research,

               a technology of extraction: from the energy and minerals needed
               to build and sustain its infrastructure, to the exploited workers
               behind "automated" services, to the data AI collects from us.
               Rather than taking a narrow focus on code and algorithms,
               Crawford offers us a political and a material perspective on what
               it takes to make artificial intelligence and where it goes wrong.
               While technical systems present a veneer of objectivity, they are
               always systems of power. This is an urgent account of what is at
               stake as technology companies use artificial intelligence to

               shaping the built environment. Combining social critique, design

               as a participatory “game” of competing interests, constraints,
               and opportunities. Through vivid graphics, collages, and essays
               from contemporaries like Archigram and Buckminster Fuller, Crosby
               exposes the failures of postwar planning—its inhuman scale, car
               dependency, and profit-driven development—while urging readers to
               question and engage with the system shaping their surroundings.

               concern for craftsmanship and meaning, the book captures a
               pivotal shift in Crosby’s thinking from avant-garde modernism
               toward populist and heritage-based approaches to urban design.
               Its warnings about unsustainable growth, social division, and the

                 potential of work as a means of learning: through the Working
                 as Learning Framework (WALF).Drawing on a four year

                 the organisation of work and performance; this edition of
                 Praxis highlights wide variances in the opportunities available
                 to employees to learn and develop, even within jobs that are
                 ostensibly identical. Why do some exercise instructors have
                 more opportunity to learn and develop than others? How can
                 changes to the management structures of primary care in the NHS
                 impact on the capacity of Health Visitors to collaborate and
                 innovate?The answer, the authors argue, lies in the workplace
                 but also, crucially, in the wider context of the productive
                 systems and processes that shape the workplace as either an

  abstract  = {Activity theory -- a conceptual framework originally developed by
               Aleksei Leontiev -- has its roots in the socio-cultural tradition
               in Russian psychology. The foundational concept of the theory is
               human activity, which is understood as purposeful, mediated, and
               transformative interaction between human beings and the world.
               Since the early 1990s, activity theory has been a visible
               landmark in the theoretical landscape of Human-Computer
               Interaction (HCI). Along with some other frameworks, such as
               distributed cognition and phenomenology, it established itself as
               a leading post-cognitivist approach in HCI and interaction
               design. In this book we discuss the conceptual foundations of
               activity theory and its contribution to HCI research. After
               making the case for theory in HCI and briefly discussing the
               contribution of activity theory to the field (Chapter One) we
               introduce the historical roots, main ideas, and principles of
               activity theory (Chapter Two). After that we present in-depth
               analyses of three issues which we consider of special importance
               to current developments in HCI and interaction design, namely:
               agency (Chapter Three), experience (Chapter Four), and
               activity-centric computing (Chapter Five). We conclude the book
               with reflections on challenges and prospects for further
               development of activity theory in HCI (Chapter Six). Table of

               functional outcomes (e.g., having the knowledge needed to get the
               work done), but also because it has implications for the meaning
               and legitimacy of work. Expertise confers power. Building on
               previous work that has compartmentalized expertise differences
               according to discrete knowledge areas or knowledge typologies, we
               enumerate a taxonomy of expertise forms: technical, arcane,
               relational, and embodied. This taxonomy illuminates how the
               practice of expertise involves knowledge about the technical
               properties of work; the policies, standards, and laws that govern
               it; the people involved; and a material sense of the spaces in
               which work takes place. We argue that experts must negotiate the
               multiplicity of their expertise in their interaction with
               different audiences and that these forms of expertise involve
               differing standards of legitimate performance, differing
               encumbrance on the work of others, and differing sources of
               authority.},

               businesses will shape the future economy. Following this
               intention, last year’s International Conference on Theory and
               Applications in the Knowledge Eco- nomy (TAKE) targeted pressing
               questions that are relevant for both academics and practitioners.
               The conference was hosted by the Institute for Applied Research
               on Skilled Crafts and Trades in academic partnership with our
               division at the WU Vienna University of Economic and Business. It
               was not only the largest TAKE conference in terms of submissions

               investigate the knowledge economy, both from a scientific as well

               we compiled selected conference articles of distinguished
               scholars. While consistently adopting a knowledge and learning

                  highest level of prefabrication among off-site construction

                  stage of MiC, while investigations into the productivity of
                  the MiC installation process with the consideration of
                  pragmatic factors, especially for high-rise buildings, are

                  motivation, training, equipment maintenance, etc.); (2)
                  developing a mathematical model to understand the relationship
                  between productivity and various resources utilized in MiC
                  installation. After verifying and validating the DES model, it
                  was applied to a case study in Hong Kong. A sensitivity
                  analysis using a full factorial experiment design was
                  conducted to identify the parameters (e.g., number of trucks,
                  tower cranes, different crews) that significantly affect a
                  number of performance measures, such as the project duration,
                  productivity, and total costs. Furthermore, the mathematical
                  model shows high prediction accuracy, as the mean absolute
                  percentage error is 8.93\%. This study would help construction
                  practitioners in their decision-making process, while planning
                  a project by providing them with a model that can predict the
                  productivity of the MiC installation process before and during
                  the project implementation.},

  abstract     = {In the article, ?What examiners do: What thesis students
                  should know?, we identified 11 things that thesis examiners do
                  as they read and judge a thesis. But, we left a gap in the
                  research: knowing this, What should thesis students do to
                  write for their examiners? In this article, I fill the gap.
                  The advice for thesis students is: first, treat your examiners
                  as friends who want you to pass, and write calmly without
                  agonising about getting it perfect. Aim to make your thesis
                  reader-friendly, and do a thorough proofread to remove
                  distracting errors. Identify the field(s) you will contribute
                  to, and make your thesis interesting and convincing for
                  examiners from this field. Write a draft, get feedback and use
                  this to improve your thesis. Help your examiners to follow
                  your train of thought: explain what you are doing and why,
                  especially if your thesis differs from what they would expect.
                  Convince your examiners that you have a sound interpretation
                  of the literature, an important topic and an appropriate
                  method, and that your conclusions make a significant,
                  publishable contribution to your field. When you have
                  submitted, expect lots of examiner comments, most of which can
                  help you improve.},

  abstract     = {A decade ago, massively open online courses (MOOCs) were
                  heralded as the solution to universal, global access to higher
                  education. While they failed to reach this vision, primarily
                  because of teaching-by-telling and learning-by-listening (a
                  PDF of the residential classroom), MOOCs provided the
                  foundational models and infrastructure for emergency remote
                  learning in the pandemic. Reports of remote learning’s death
                  post-pandemic are greatly exaggerated, since the world is now
                  irreversibly hybrid—and will stay that way because many people
                  and organizations value the new opportunities this presents.
                  From now on, when students leave the shelter of classrooms to
                  interact with the world beyond schooling, they must have
                  skills for adept performance both face-to-face and across
                  distance. Colleges, universities, and regions that force all
                  teaching and learning to be face-to-face are dooming their
                  graduates to reduced agency in every other aspect of life. As
                  discussed in recent reports from Harvard, MIT, and Stanford,
                  innovative approaches to digital learning were developed
                  during the pandemic that are now improving campus-based
                  learning. Insights from these approaches offer the opportunity
                  for student engagement at scale, taking advantage of strengths
                  of online instruction such as collapsing time, bridging space,
                  personalizing via rich datastreams, using AI-based
                  instructional assistants and learning partners, delivering
                  content and experience across universities, and sustaining
                  online learning communities after formal instruction ends.
                  Combined, these advances can enable next-generation massive
                  digital hybrid learning, a means to achieve the aspirational
                  vision of universal global access to higher education. A
                  coalition of higher education institutions could begin to
                  realize this vision, an essential step in enabling all
                  learners to survive and thrive in our increasingly turbulent,
                  disruptive global economy and civilization.},

                  in their ability to perform complex multi-step reasoning.
                  However, even state-of-the-art models still regularly produce
                  logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn
                  either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a
                  final result, or process supervision, which provides feedback
                  for each intermediate reasoning step. Given the importance of
                  training reliable models, and given the high cost of human
                  feedback, it is important to carefully compare the both
                  methods. Recent work has already begun this comparison, but
                  many questions still remain. We conduct our own investigation,
                  finding that process supervision significantly outperforms
                  outcome supervision for training models to solve problems from
                  the challenging MATH dataset. Our process-supervised model
                  solves 78\% of problems from a representative subset of the
                  MATH test set. Additionally, we show that active learning
                  significantly improves the efficacy of process supervision. To
                  support related research, we also release PRM800K, the
                  complete dataset of 800,000 step-level human feedback labels
                  used to train our best reward model.},

               education systems, and their form, goals, and practices, are
               increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey (1916)
               refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the provision of
               detailed national prespecified outcomes, course content, forms of
               assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and continuity of these
               educational provisions arise in response to how individuals
               engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey refers to as the
               ?personal side??albeit in interdependent ways. That is, there is
               mutual dependence between the personal and social sides.
               Regardless of whether it is directed to pragmatic purposes or
               educational efficacy, vocational education relies on individual
               experiencing and engagement, interdependently. Ultimately,

               developments have been the widespread adoption of
               competency-based training (CBT) and a shift toward greater
               privatization of VET. Although more holistic understandings of
               competence, which better reflect highly skilled occupational
               performance, are available, too often VET providers have settled
               for a more minimalist concept: one that views competence as a
               mere checklist of discrete skills. This chapter draws upon both
               the findings of workplace learning research and some perennial
               themes from VET's long history. It poses the critical question:
               What are the desirable foundations for a reimagined VET, one that

  abstract     = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a chronic
                  neurobehavioral disorder that is highly prevalent in children
                  and adults. An increasing number of patients with ADHD are
                  self-medicating with cannabis, despite a lack of evidence on
                  efficacy and safety. This case report describes 3 males (ages
                  18, 22, and 23) who have integrated cannabis into their
                  treatment regimen with positive results. Semistructured
                  interviews conducted with the patients describe subjective
                  improvements in symptoms and on quality of life. Improvements
                  on validated rating scales conducted post-cannabis initiation,
                  compared to pre-cannabis initiation obtained from the medical
                  chart, corroborated their personal accounts. Scores on the
                  PHQ-9 (measuring depression) improved by 8–22 points
                  (30–81\%), and the SCARED (measuring anxiety) ranged from 0 to
                  27 points (up to 33\%). Improvements on the CEER-9 scale
                  (measuring regulation) ranged from 2 to 7 points (22–78\%),
                  and the 9-item SNAP scale (measuring inattention) showed
                  improvements of 2–8 points (7–30\%). Mild adverse events
                  including short-term memory problems, dry mouth, and
                  sleepiness were reported. Blood samples were also collected
                  from the patients to determine the plasma concentrations of
                  the cannabinoids and relevant metabolites before and after a
                  cannabis administration. After cannabis use, the plasma levels
                  for CBD and THC ranged from 0 to 15.29 ng/mL and 1.32 to 13.76
                  ng/mL, respectively. Cannabinoids, however, were not detected
                  prior to dosing, suggesting that cannabis played a
                  complimentary role in the therapeutic regimen of these 3
                  patients. Clinical trials are recommended to confirm the
                  efficacy of cannabis in the treatment of ADHD.},

               book contains two sections: first, general critiques of the
               limits of current notions of a knowledge economy and required
               adult learning, in terms of historical comparisons,
               socio-political construction and current empirical evidence;
               secondly, specific challenges to presumed relations between work
               requirements and learning through case studies in diverse current
               workplaces that document richer learning processes than knowledge
               economy advocates intimate. Many of the leading authors in the
               field are represented. There are no other books to date that both
               critically assess the limits of the notion of the knowledge
               economy and examine closely the relation of workplace
               restructuring to lifelong learning beyond the confines of formal
               higher education and related educational policies. This reader
               provides a distinctive overview for future studies of relations
               between work and learning in contemporary societies beyond
               caricatures of the knowledge economy. The book should be of

               a remarkably wide following. Its appeal owes a good deal to the
               seductive character of community, aptly described as a ‘warmly
               persuasive word’ (Williams, 1976, p. 66). As Østerlund and
               Carlile (2005) note, most citations of Lave and Wenger have
               focused on community and ignored practice. Yet it is practice
               that makes the CoP, the social locus in which a practice is
               sustained and reproduced overtime, a distinct type of community1
               practice is thus critical to CoP analysis. We should not,
               however, lose sight of the community. The CoP is inherently and

                setup, while they are immersed into a vir- tual or remote
                location by means of avatars or surrogates. In order to gain a
                better understanding of how living in such a virtual environment
                (VE) would impact human beings, we conducted a self-experiment
                in which we exposed a single participant in an immersive VR
                setup for 24 hours (divided into repeated sessions of two hours
                VR exposure followed by ten minutes breaks), which is to our
                knowledge the longest documented use of an immersive VEs so far.
                We measured different metrics to analyze how human perception,
                behav- ior, cognition, and motor system change over time in a
                fully isolated virtual world.},

                  for the creation of artefacts that have a purpose and
                  existence beyond the life cycle of an accreditation process.
                  The context for the paper is the UK’s automotive manufacturing
                  industry, a sector that has undergone considerable change over
                  the past thirty or so years and has been under intense
                  pressure to improve standards. The paper presents evidence
                  from case studies of two companies that produce parts for
                  global car manufacturers. These companies have introduced
                  competence-based approaches in order to audit and assess the
                  skills of their workforces in response to demands from the
                  companies they supply that they can prove their employees are
                  working to the required international quality standards. The
                  competence-based approach, which is contested in the academic
                  literature, has enabled employees to gain National Vocational
                  Qualifications (NVQs), which, in turn, are still controversial
                  some twenty years after they were first introduced. The paper
                  argues that a competence-based approach can be beneficial to
                  both organisations and individuals, but the ambiguities
                  inherent in the NVQ model of competence create tensions and
                  opportunities for restrictive as well as expansive forms
                  implementation.},

                  particular subset of Virtual Reality (VR) related technologies
                  that involve the merging of real and virtual worlds somewhere
                  along the virtuality continuum" which connects completely real
                  environments to completely virtual ones. Probably the best
                  known of these is Augmented Reality (AR), which refers to all
                  cases in which the display of an otherwise real environment is
                  augmented by means of virtual (computer graphic) objects. The
                  converse case on the virtuality continuum is therefore
                  Augmented Virtuality (AV). Six classes of hybrid MR display
                  environments are identified. However, an attempt to
                  distinguish these classes on the basis of whether they are
                  primarily video or computer graphics based, whether the real
                  world is viewed directly or via some electronic display
                  medium, whether the viewer is intended to feel part of the
                  world or on the outside looking in, and whether or not the
                  scale of the display is intended to map orthoscopically onto
                  the real world leads to quite different groupings among the
                  six identified classes, thereby demonstrating the need for an
                  efficient taxonomy, or classification framework, according to
                  which essential differences can be identified. The obvious'
                  distinction between the terms real" and virtual" is shown to
                  have a number of different aspects, depending on whether one
                  is dealing with real or virtual objects, real or virtual
                  images, and direct or non-direct viewing of these. An
                  (approximately) three dimensional taxonomy is proposed,
                  comprising the following dimensions: Extent of World Knowledge
                  (how much do we know about the world being displayed?"),
                  Reproduction Fidelity (how realistically' are we able to
                  display it?"), and Extent of Presence Metaphor (what is the
                  extent of the illusion that the observer is present within
                  that world?").},

                  land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an

                  buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2
                  could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to

                  transforming education and fostering innovative approaches to
                  learning. Blended learning, an increasingly popular approach,
                  integrates technology with traditional teaching approaches.
                  Blended learning can overcome the limitations associated with
                  using technology purely as a tool, facilitating its full
                  integration into the educational process. The present study
                  involved 106 students enrolled in a vocational education
                  program (VET) in Slovenia. The students were subjected to a
                  pilot implementation of blended learning, and their
                  experiences were subsequently analyzed and evaluated. The
                  results showed that the use of different teaching approaches
                  led to different outcomes in terms of student workload,
                  learning outcomes, and motivation. The different teaching
                  approaches were found to present different levels of
                  difficulty for students. For example, live sessions and the
                  integration of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR /AR)
                  technology presented greater challenges. Conversely,
                  collaborative group work and online courses focused on
                  developing professional skills were found to be beneficial.
                  The study also highlighted the importance of feedback and
                  instructor support in online learning environments. In
                  general, the results of our study suggest that the adoption of
                  blended learning in education can lead to positive outcomes.
                  However, it is important to emphasize the importance of

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used in
                  healthcare settings as recent technological advancements
                  create possibilities for diagnosis and treatment. VR is a
                  technology that uses a headset to simulate a reality in which
                  the user is immersed in a virtual environment, creating the
                  impression that the user is physically present in this virtual
                  space. Despite the potential added value of virtual reality
                  technology in healthcare, its uptake in clinical practice is
                  still in its infancy and challenges arise in the
                  implementation of VR. Effective implementation could improve
                  the adoption, uptake, and impact of VR. However, these
                  implementation procedures still seem to be understudied in
                  practice. This scoping review aimed to examine the current
                  state of affairs in the implementation of VR technology in
                  healthcare settings and to provide an overview of factors
                  related to the implementation of VR. METHODS: To give an
                  overview of relevant literature, a scoping review was
                  undertaken of articles published up until February 2022,
                  guided by the methodological framework of Arksey and O'Malley
                  (2005). The databases Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science
                  were systematically searched to identify records that
                  highlighted the current state of affairs regarding the
                  implementation of VR in healthcare settings. Information about
                  each study was extracted using a structured data extraction
                  form. RESULTS: Of the 5523 records identified, 29 were
                  included in this study. Most studies focused on barriers and
                  facilitators to implementation, highlighting similar factors
                  related to the behavior of adopters of VR and the practical
                  resources the organization should arrange for. However, few
                  studies focus on systematic implementation and on using a
                  theoretical framework to guide implementation. Despite the
                  recommendation of using a structured, multi-level
                  implementation intervention to support the needs of all
                  involved stakeholders, there was no link between the
                  identified barriers and facilitators, and specific
                  implementation objectives or suitable strategies to overcome
                  these barriers in the included articles. CONCLUSION: To take
                  the implementation of VR in healthcare to the next level, it
                  is important to ensure that implementation is not studied in
                  separate studies focusing on one element, e.g., healthcare
                  provider-related barriers, as is common in current literature.
                  Based on the results of this study, we recommend that the
                  implementation of VR entails the entire process, from
                  identifying barriers to developing and employing a coherent,
                  multi-level implementation intervention with suitable
                  strategies. This implementation process could be supported by
                  implementation frameworks and ideally focus on behavior change
                  of stakeholders such as healthcare providers, patients, and
                  managers. This in turn might result in increased uptake and
                  use of VR technologies that are of added value for healthcare
                  practice.},

                  training is gaining increasing importance in vocational
                  education and training (VET). However, while IVR is primarily
                  investigated and utilized in technical domains, its
                  implementation and the resulting effects in commercial
                  education remain largely unexplored. Moreover, the experience
                  of motion sickness is a widely reported phenomenon while using
                  IVR, which can interfere with cognitive processes and should
                  therefore be considered more closely in terms of learning and
                  instruction. This explorative study focuses on domain-specific
                  knowledge acquisition in vocational apprenticeship for
                  retailers and the accompanying side effects on students’
                  wellbeing in an IVR-based learning environment. For this
                  purpose, an IVR-based scenario in a virtual supermarket was
                  developed and tested with trainees in the field of retail at a
                  German commercial vocational school. Using a
                  quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, we compared the
                  effects of IVR-based and conventional instruction on
                  domain-specific knowledge acquisition in a sample of
                  first-year trainees (N = 79). The findings indicate an
                  advantage of IVR in the acquisition of domain-specific
                  knowledge (ɳ2 = .261). Although moderate motion sickness
                  symptoms were reported in the experimental group, no direct
                  links between the experience of motion sickness and learning
                  outcomes could be identified. These findings advance the
                  current knowledge about learning-related effects of IVR-based
                  instruction in the field of VET and provide further
                  understanding about the special conditions of IVR scenarios
                  conducive to learning.},

                  highlight an area of mismatch between normative versus lived

                  Building on the theory of hierarchical opposition by Louis
                  Dumont and empirical data collected through ethnographic
                  research at a company classified as a small- and medium-sized
                  enterprise (SME) in the German metal industry, this paper
                  addresses the emergence of workarounds in collaborative work
                  processes by setting them into the wider organisational
                  context. The organisational layer of analysis reveals that
                  workarounds emerge to cater for inversed information power
                  relations and information asymmetries in the shop floor

                  has developed a continuum of participatory research methods,
                  closely mirroring methodological approaches and
                  epistemological discussions in other fields. This paper
                  positions such approaches as examples of inclusive research
                  (to varying degrees) within education, and illustrates the
                  complexity of navigating and involving different user groups
                  in the context of multi-disciplinary research projects. We
                  illustrate this complexity with examples from our recent work,
                  involving children on the autism spectrum and their teachers.
                  Both groups were involved in learner-centred design processes
                  to develop technologies to support social conversation and
                  collaboration. We conceptualize this complexity as a
                  triple-decker ?sandwich? representing Theory, Technologies and
                  Thoughts and argue that all three layers need to be
                  appropriately aligned for a good quality ?product? or outcome.
                  However, the challenge lies in navigating and negotiating all
                  three layers at the same time, including the views and
                  experiences of the learners. We question the extent to which
                  it may be possible to combine co-operative, empowering
                  approaches to participatory design with an outcome-focused
                  agenda that seeks to develop a robust learning technology for

  abstract   = {Virtual reality (VR) systems have been increasingly used in
                recent years in various domains, such as education and training.
                Presence, which can be described as `the sense of being there'
                is one of the most important user experience aspects in VR.
                There are several components, which may affect the level of
                presence, such as interaction, visual fidelity, and auditory
                cues. In recent years, a significant effort has been put into
                increasing the sense of presence in VR. This study focuses on
                improving user experience in VR by increasing presence through
                increased interaction fidelity and enhanced illusions.
                Interaction in real life includes mutual and bidirectional
                encounters between two or more individuals through shared
                tangible objects. However, the majority of VR interaction to
                date has been unidirectional. This research aims to bridge this
                gap by enabling bidirectional mutual tangible embodied
                interactions between human users and virtual characters in
                world-fixed VR through real-virtual shared objects that extend
                from virtual world into the real world. I hypothesize that the
                proposed novel interaction will shrink the boundary between the
                real and virtual worlds (through virtual characters that affect
                the physical world), increase the seamlessness of the VR system
                (enhance the illusion) and the fidelity of interaction, and
                increase the level of presence and social presence, enjoyment
                and engagement. This paper includes the motivation, design and
                development details of the proposed novel world-fixed VR system

                affect the occurrence of such events. The experiment involved 35
                participants who used a tablet AR application to explore
                structural behaviour through problem solving exercises. The
                tablet augmented the physical model of a structure with the
                information about the applied loads and the internal forces.
                Participants were asked to identify the nature of some forces by
                visual inspection. During the task they could freely navigate
                around the structure and touch it. Our results suggest that the
                amount of shifts to real-world objects is related to the user's
                spatial orientation rather than on the user's spatial skills or
                the digital augmentation flaws. Specifically, the probability of
                looking at the physical layer increases when rapid movements are
                performed. The task difficulty and the perceived

                  communication before journal articles. Attention to visual
                  attributes can enhance academic poster communication.
                  Objective: This investigation's purpose was to create a visual
                  impression measurement instrument, and then to describe and
                  compare visual impression among scientific posters from an
                  academic conference. Methods: A mixed-approach rubric was
                  created to quickly measure visual impression of academic
                  posters. Then, posters from a pharmacy education conference
                  were retrospectively reviewed and scored. Visual impression
                  was compared for traditional versus contemporary
                  poster-formats. Various poster characteristics (poster-format,
                  summary statement presence, abstract presence, wordiness,
                  QR-code presence, logical sequencing, visuals) that might have
                  impacted visual communication were coded. These
                  characteristics were regressed onto visual impression scores.
                  Results: Three-hundred seventy-eight posters were scored with
                  sound inter-rater reliability. Contemporary poster-format
                  scored significantly higher than traditional. Poster-format,
                  abstract absence, lack of wordiness, QR-code presence, logical
                  sequencing, and number of visuals were significant when
                  regressed. Conclusion: Posters at one academic conference had
                  varied visual impression. While a contemporary poster-format
                  appeared more helpful, it was not a panacea; variation from
                  poor through exemplary was seen with both poster-formats.
                  Posters are not text-filled articles; displaying a combination
                  of visuals/text clearly and concisely can help effective
                  communication with academic posters.},

                  associated with increased risks of adverse health outcomes
                  including premature death, but it is unclear whether ADHD
                  pharmacotherapy influences the mortality risk. Objective: To
                  investigate whether initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy was
                  associated with reduced mortality risk in individuals with
                  ADHD. Design, Setting, and Participants: In an observational
                  nationwide cohort study in Sweden applying the target trial
                  emulation framework, we identified individuals aged 6 through
                  64 years with an incident diagnosis of ADHD from 2007 through
                  2018 and no ADHD medication dispensation prior to diagnosis.
                  Follow-up started from ADHD diagnosis until death, emigration,
                  2 years after ADHD diagnosis, or December 31, 2020, whichever
                  came first. Exposures: ADHD medication initiation was defined
                  as dispensing of medication within 3 months of diagnosis. Main
                  Outcomes and Measures: We assessed all-cause mortality within
                  2 years of ADHD diagnosis, as well as natural-cause (eg,
                  physical conditions) and unnatural-cause mortality (eg,
                  unintentional injuries, suicide, and accidental poisonings).
                  Results: Of 148 578 individuals with ADHD (61 356 females
                  [41.3\%]), 84 204 (56.7\%) initiated ADHD medication. The
                  median age at diagnosis was 17.4 years (IQR, 11.6-29.1 years).
                  The 2-year mortality risk was lower in the initiation
                  treatment strategy group (39.1 per 10 000 individuals) than in
                  the noninitiation treatment strategy group (48.1 per 10 000
                  individuals), with a risk difference of -8.9 per 10 000
                  individuals (95\% CI, -17.3 to -0.6). ADHD medication
                  initiation was associated with significantly lower rate of
                  all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.70 to
                  0.88) and unnatural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk,
                  25.9 per 10 000 individuals vs 33.3 per 10 000 individuals;
                  risk difference, -7.4 per 10 000 individuals; 95\% CI, -14.2
                  to -0.5; HR, 0.75; 95\% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), but not
                  natural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 13.1 per 10
                  000 individuals vs 14.7 per 10 000 individuals; risk
                  difference, -1.6 per 10 000 individuals; 95\% CI, -6.4 to 3.2;
                  HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 1.05). Conclusions and Relevance:
                  Among individuals diagnosed with ADHD, medication initiation
                  was associated with significantly lower all-cause mortality,

               interviewing: (a) How do you do it? and (b) How do you analyze

               theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to
               personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data.
               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive
               steps that successively lead the researcher from studying
               concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of
               them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and
               Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories
               from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to
               conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate
               relations between conceptual categories and to specify the
               conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change,
               or are maintained.},

  abstract     = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to provide practical
                  recommendations for shadowing as a method of organizational
                  study with a focus on the situated processes and practices of
                  shadowing fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach– This paper
                  reflects on the shadowing experiences of three researchers –
                  in a hospital emergency department, nuclear power plants, and
                  entrepreneur workspaces – to generate recommendations by
                  identifying and synthesizing solutions that emerged during the
                  encounters with the challenges and opportunities in shadowing.
                  Findings– Considering shadowing as an ongoing and emergent
                  research process can be helpful to prepare for particular
                  aspects of shadowing fieldwork. Shadowing presents research
                  challenges that may emerge in the practice of fieldwork,
                  including how to negotiate awkward conversations with
                  participants, what to bring and wear, and how to take notes.
                  Practical implications– Though the recommendations for
                  shadowing are based on particular experiences and may not
                  generalize to all shadowing engagements, they offer concrete,
                  practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The
                  recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate
                  and situational character of shadowing, and offer strategies
                  for coping with the distinctive requirements of shadowing.
                  Originality/value– By looking across diverse experiences of
                  shadowing, the paper generated guidelines that help to make
                  sense of shadowing processes, manage uncertainty in the field,
                  and build on the emerging work on shadowing. The ten
                  recommendations provide insight into shadowing that are of
                  particular value to graduate students, junior researchers, and
                  those new to shadowing. Moreover, the experienced shadower may
                  find value in the camaraderie of shared experience, the
                  concrete ideas about another's experience of shadowing, and
                  insight in recommendations that capture aspects of fieldwork
                  that they are also exploring.},

                  for clinical training is the implementation of a near-peer
                  shadowing program, in which pre-clinical trainees shadow
                  clinical trainees. AIMS: This article describes techniques for
                  ensuring the effectiveness of a near-peer shadowing program in
                  the hope of improving the preparedness of students for
                  clinical training. METHOD: A list of 12 tips were developed by
                  combining a review of the literature with a reflection upon
                  the authors' own experiences with developing a near-peer
                  shadowing program, in which first-year medical students
                  shadowed first-year residents. RESULTS: Both successes and
                  failures were identified, both in the literature and in the
                  author's own experiences. These can be used to inform the
                  development of future programs. CONCLUSIONS: A near-peer
                  shadowing program has the strong potential to play a key role
                  in preparing students to enter clinical training. These 12
                  tips, drawn from the literature and our own experience, will
                  maximize the benefits for both student and tutor learning and
                  minimize the potential pitfalls encountered by other programs.},

  abstract     = {Construction companies are project-based organizations, since
                  much of their knowledge is generated on site, from projects
                  they carry out. In fact, projects are an important source of
                  expert know-how and organizational knowledge, but
                  lessons-learned from them are not systematically incorporated
                  into subsequent projects, evidencing a lack of knowledge
                  management and learning culture in local construction
                  companies. This article describes a research effort that
                  addressed this situation and developed a lessons-learned
                  system to help construction companies to overcome these
                  limitations. A multiple case-study methodology was applied to
                  understand the knowledge and learning realities and needs of
                  three Chilean construction companies. Based on these results,
                  a mobile cloud-shared workspace to support knowledge
                  management was developed. Results show that major concerns of
                  users are associated with how the system acknowledges the
                  particularities of construction projects and how it will be
                  incorporated into daily activities. Main conclusions indicate
                  that (1) companies acknowledge the need to develop a culture
                  of innovation within the organization, (2) users consider the
                  system as a tool that could really contribute to improve the
                  construction project management process, and (3) the system
                  needs improvements regarding database search and the Internet
                  support before being fully implemented in the company as a
                  project management tool.},

                  six primary reasons why rapid techniques were used: (a) reduce
                  time, (b) reduce cost, (c) increase the amount of collected
                  data, (d) improve efficiency, (e) improve accuracy, and (f)
                  obtain a closer approximation to the narrated realities of

                  substantially. Unions in 1991 are infrequently consulted and
                  have very little influence. In addition, the legislative
                  framework within which unions operate is very different; their
                  activities are much more circumscribed by the law than
                  previously. But much less has changed on the shopfloor; for
                  example, there is limited evidence of a major move to
                  derecognise unions or restrict collective bargaining.
                  Governments can only set the legislative framework within
                  which shopfloor industrial relations operate; it cannot
                  determine outcomes.]},

                  formal model indicates that declining union election activity
                  may be due to an unfavourable political climate which raises
                  the costs of unionization, even though the union win–rate
                  remains unaffected. We relate the timing of declining election
                  activity to the air–traffic controllers’ strike of 1981, and
                  the appointment of the Reagan Labor Board in 1983. Empirical

                  highlight the central role played by the learning process in
                  individual career development and organizational success. In
                  such fast-moving working contexts, skills and competencies
                  rapidly become outdated and need to be continuously
                  implemented and empowered as a strategic factor for global

                  complexity of such a process, weaving between and overlapping

                  competence development activities provided by the Production
                  Leap, a workplace development programme (WPDP), were
                  interwoven with everyday work activities and to identify the
                  conditions that enabled learning and employee-driven
                  innovation that contributed to production improvement, in
                  small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Sweden. The study
                  adopts a qualitative case approach and draws on evidence from
                  research conducted in four manufacturing SMEs that
                  participated in this Swedish WPDP. Funded by EU authorities,
                  WPDPs provide competence development activities to SMEs in
                  order to boost their production capabilities and/or promote
                  innovation. The findings reveal that the competence
                  development activities provided by the programme triggered
                  learning in everyday work activities and fostered the
                  development of different approaches to employee-driven
                  innovation in the enterprises. The conclusion is that it is
                  essential to consider that employee-driven innovations may
                  take different forms and involve functions that can support
                  innovative learning that goes beyond minor adjustments to the
                  existing standards of production. Moreover, employee-driven
                  innovation may impose new demands on management leadership
                  skills. The findings provide important guidance for future
                  WPDPs, for vocational education and training or university
                  activities that are customised to SME contexts to promote
                  production capabilities, and for SMEs that aim to strengthen

                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards
                 those at the top of the occupational hierarchy; (7) Much of the
                 qualitative evidence shows that learning occurs naturally in
                 all workplaces as part of everyday activity in line with the
                 learning as participation approach; (8) Workplace learning
                 takes many forms stretching across a 'formal-informal'
                 continuum; (9) International research evidence suggests that
                 the key inter-related determinants in the variability of
                 workplace learning environments are context and individual
                 behaviour; and (10) External recognition and accreditation of
                 workplace learning is problematic due to its largely collective
                 and dynamic nature.},

               VET research is concerned with exploring continuity as well as

                  in VET is changing due to technological innovation and the
                  shift towards a knowledge economy. The discussion sets out
                  from the question how vocational or professional knowledge may
                  be distinguished from other forms of knowledge and what
                  philosophical and epistemological traits may underpin this
                  distinction. Building on an analysis of ‘intrinsic’ and
                  ‘extrinsic’ conceptions of knowledge, the paper explores how
                  appropriate descriptors for the classification of theoretical
                  or propositional knowledge as well as practical knowledge may
                  be identified. As a result, a proposal for structuring
                  vocational knowledge is presented. The concluding part
                  addresses the question how the proposed categories may serve
                  to characterise changes in vocational knowledge and explores

  abstract     = {Purpose– The primary objective in this paper is to examine the
                  role of small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in promoting
                  and/or hindering educational opportunities to adult employees
                  in the UK.Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws on 12
                  case studies of SMEs in England and Scotland, which form part
                  of a larger European Sixth Framework Programme research
                  project. Interviews were conducted with employers, line
                  managers and employees participating in formal educational
                  programmes, and were contextualized with policy documents and
                  literature on lifelong learning and workplace
                  education.Findings– This paper highlights and explores
                  findings related to human resource management (HRM) and the
                  participation of employees in formal education, and the
                  experiences of companies in providing educational
                  opportunities to employees in England and Scotland. The paper
                  argues that employers have a key role to play in driving and
                  investing in employee training and development. However, the
                  current focus of employers on formal educational opportunities
                  appears narrowly focused on job‐specific, in‐house
                  training.Originality/value– The paper's value lies in its
                  illustration of the restricted focus of the lifelong learning
                  policy agenda on the development of human capital, which not
                  only limits the development of portable skills and
                  qualifications for employees, but also undermines the broader
                  aims of lifelong learning.},

                  A quasi-experimental pre-posttest control group design was
                  used to conduct the study. A total of 387 participants
                  completed three assignment activities either in SL or using
                  two-dimensional (2-D) images. Students were administered an
                  11-question chemistry achievement test and two measures of
                  spatial ability (Purdue Visualization of Rotations Test, Card

               and the learning challenge it presents for individuals,

               the role of knowledge in the economy has been framed in terms of
               Cartesian notions of objective and subjective knowledge and human
               capital notions that the aim of learning is to support people to
               adapt to a pre-given economic reality. The book argues that these
               framings rest on questionable assumptions about knowledge and
               learning and, in the process, deflect us from asking questions
               about our future economic, political and social direction. Taking
               ideas from Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT), Social
               Theory and the Philosophy of Mind as its starting point, the book

               activity. It explores this rethinking through the form of
               learning—Professional, Vocational and Workplace—most closely
               associated with the use of knowledge for economic, political and
               social purposes.},

                  learning (WIL) has expanded considerably. While early research
                  predominantly utilized quantitative study designs, recently a
                  more diverse set of methodologies is being used to address
                  questions and issues arising from a range of WIL models. This
                  Special Issue is intended to present different methodologies
                  available to WIL researchers. The papers include case studies
                  of how these methodologies, and methods within, are being used
                  for WIL research, along with discussion of the strengths and
                  limitations of using the research approach. Examples of case
                  study methodology, multiple case studies, mixed methods,
                  program evaluation research, hermeneutic phenomenology,
                  grounded theory, reflective practice as research, and

                  as 'insiders' within their own organizations are also

                  particular contexts making it highly suited to flexible,
                  multiple perspective methodologies, such as case study.
                  However, case study methodology is often criticized for being
                  too specific, not generalizable and limited in what it can
                  contribute to theory. In addition, there is often confusion
                  between the meaning and application of the terms method and
                  methodology. This paper presents an argument to help guide and
                  support researchers who are considering a case study approach
                  to their WIL research. Two vignettes demonstrate how
                  researchers overcame some of the alleged limitations of case
                  study as a methodology and utilized the benefits to advance
                  the theory and practice of WIL. Case study provides a sound
                  methodology that can reflect the variability of research
                  contexts and enables a flexible approach to address a wide

  abstract     = {[John Dewey and L. S. Vygotsky share similar ideas concerning
                  the relationship of activity and learning/development,
                  especially the roles everyday activities and social
                  environment play in the educational process. However, the two
                  theorists are far apart in their conception of the
                  relationship between process and goals in education. Dewey
                  concentrates on means in education, believing that it is the
                  ability of the individual to question through experience that
                  is most important for the human community. Vygotsky, while
                  recognizing the importance of (especially cultural) process in
                  education, sees social and cultural goals as being integrated
                  into social pedagogy. This paper compares Dewey and Vygotsky
                  on three key points that relate directly to educational
                  processes and goals. First, the two theorists are compared on
                  the role of social history and the tools it produces. Dewey
                  sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools that
                  are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
                  tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact
                  on the social community. Second, the two theorists are
                  compared in their conceptualizations of experience/culture.
                  Dewey sees experience as helping to form thinking, whereas
                  Vygotsky, in his cultural historical theory, posits culture as
                  the raw material of thinking. Third, the two theorists are
                  compared on their perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees
                  the child as a free agent who achieves goals through her own
                  interest in the activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be
                  greater control by a mentor who creates activity that will
                  lead the child towards mastery. These differences are then
                  explored in terms of how they might impact actual classroom
                  strategies and curriculum.]},

               organisational learning, software design, innovation and
               biomimetics. This book is particularly novel and timely, as it
               brings together a number of cogent subjects under one collective
               ‘umbrella’. Each of these chapters contain original findings, all
               of which culminate in three 'Key Learning Points' which provide
               new insight into the cross-cutting themes, interrelationships and
               symbiotic forces that exist between each of these chapters. This
               approach also provides readers with new contextualised
               understanding of the wider issues affecting the offsite market,
               from the need to embrace societal challenges, through to the
               development of rich value-laden solutions required for creating

  abstract  = {In tandem with the diffusion of computer technologies, labour
               markets across the OECD have undergone rapid structural
               transformation. In this paper, we examine i) the impact of
               technological change on labour market outcomes since the computer
               revolution of the 1980s, and ii) recent developments in digital
               technology – including machine learning and robotics – and their
               potential impacts on the future of work. While it is evident that
               the composition of the workforce has shifted dramatically over
               recent decades, in part as a result of technological change, the
               impacts of digitalisation on the future of jobs are far from
               certain. On the one hand, accumulating anecdotal evidence shows
               that the potential scope of automation has expanded beyond
               routine work, making technological change potentially
               increasingly labour-saving: according to recent estimates 47
               percent of US jobs are susceptible to automation over the
               forthcoming decades. On the other hand, there is evidence
               suggesting that digital technologies have not created many new
               jobs to replace old ones: an upper bound estimate is that around
               0.5 percent of the US workforce is employed in digital industries
               that emerged throughout the 2000s. Nevertheless, at first
               approximation, there is no evidence to suggest that the computer
               revolution so far has reduced overall demand for jobs as
               technologically stagnant sectors of the economy – including
               health care, government and personal services – continue to
               create vast employment opportunities. Looking forward, however,
               we argue that as the potential scope of automation is expanding,
               many sectors that have been technologically stagnant in the past
               are likely to become technologically progressive in the future.
               While we should expect a future surge in productivity as a
               result, the question of whether gains from increases in
               productivity will be widely shared depends on policy responses.},

               internet-enhanced society, according to Richard Susskind and
               Daniel Susskind, we will neither need nor want doctors, teachers,
               accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and
               many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future
               of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies
               - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the
               'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips
               of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face
               interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the
               arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's
               professionals. They argue that our current professions are
               antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the
               expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place,
               they propose five new models for producing and distributing
               expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not
               least about employment (they envisage a new generation of
               'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise
               (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become
               more capable than human beings at most tasks. With a new preface
               exploring recent critical developments, this updated edition
               builds on the authors' groundbreaking research into more than a
               dozen professions. Illustrated with numerous examples from each,
               this is the first book to assess and question the relevance of
               the professions in the 21st century.},

                  intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems
                  have tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics,
                  physics, and computer programming. The change of the student’s
                  cognitive behavior over time, however, has not been considered
                  and modeled systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain
                  knowledge in specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in
                  which pragmatic knowledge could play an important role, has
                  also not been taken into account deliberately. We believe that
                  the temporal dimension in modeling the student’s knowledge
                  state and cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such
                  domains. In this paper, we propose an approach for student
                  modeling and diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between
                  temporal Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis.
                  The latter may help building a powerful domain knowledge model
                  and the former may help modeling the learner’s complex
                  cognitive behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her
                  with relevant feedback during a problem-solving process. To
                  illustrate the application of the approach, we designed and
                  developed several key components of an intelligent learning
                  environment for teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw
                  fixation in orthopedic surgery, for which we videotaped and
                  analyzed six surgical interventions in a French hospital. A
                  preliminary gold-standard validation suggests that our
                  diagnosis component is able to produce coherent diagnosis with
                  acceptable response time.},

               systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based on
               individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far superior
               to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors are
               ‘intelligent tutors’ because they are able to continously adapt
               the content and style of their instruction to best meet the needs
               of the learner. The historical evolution of intelligent tutoring
               systems is presented. The starting point was programmed
               instruction in the late 1960s, followed by knowledge-based tutors
               that try to simulate good human tutors by the integrated use of
               domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and knowledge about the
               individual student. Finally some important current trends like
               distance learning, collaborative learning, and Web-based learning
               are outlined. The presentation is given within a cognitive
               science point of view. From this perspective the research on

  abstract = {The Del E. Webb School of Construction is currently involved in a
              three-year project aimed at enhancing the construction management
              education. The primary undertaking of this project-in its second
              year-is to incorporate practical content in the construction
              curricula thus bridging the gap between the classroom and the
              construction site. Enhancements are being accomplished by
              developing 1) an Internet-based Interactive Construction
              Management Learning System (ICMLS) and 2) an advising and
              mentorship program that will enhance practitioner-involvement. The
              Interactive Learning System uses interactive and adaptive learning
              environments to train students in the areas of construction
              methods, equipment and processes. This system is being developed
              using multimedia; Internet based computing; Virtual Reality
              Modeling Language (VRML); databases; and discrete-event
              simulation. This paper will provide an update on the design,
              development and implementation of ICMLS. Lessons learned and tools
              utilized that may be helpful in other branches of engineering and
              non-engineering fields will be described. The project team
              envisions that the successful completion of this project will lead
              to a number of benefits including: 1) improved recruitment,
              retention, and program completion for the construction management
              program; 2) "jobready" graduates that can be successfully employed
              in the construction industry; and 3) enhanced practitioner
              involvement and construction industry input.},

                  broader economic, regulatory, and social context within which
                  organisations have to operate. This article argues that we

                  factors (external and internal) that affect all organisations,
                  as these are central to developing our understanding of the

                  By closely examining the nature and impact of these contextual

                  why organisations adopt different practices and why they

                  on emerging findings from an ESRC?funded multisector study in

               that can create value for the industry. This chapter provides a
               thick description of business innovation typologies relating to
               the offsite construction industry in the US. Offsite construction
               is ‘the process of planning, designing, fabricating,
               transporting, and assembling building elements for rapid site
               assembly to a greater degree of finish than in traditional
               piecemeal on-site construction’. Legislatively, however, the
               process was more clearly regulated and streamlined, occurring
               primarily offsite, which helps explain why one in every ten
               housing units constructed each year today in the US are
               manufactured homes. The US economy presents new opportunities for
               permanent modular construction to compete. Disruptive, sustaining

                  and interviews, the authors find that students equipped with
                  knowledge of BIM technology is not the ultimate goal, while
                  the collaborative process of using BIM to solve practical
                  construction problems emerges as key to individuals entering
                  the industry. However, a majority of BIM-relevant courses have
                  been taught as technology training without the context of a
                  collaborative learning environment, while the industry values
                  training in collaboration as a paramount skill in possible
                  employees. To fill this gap, the authors assume that the
                  collaborative construction skills can be obtained through
                  training in higher education of construction. This work

  abstract    = {The construction industry in the UK has been characterised in
                 recent years by stagnating productivity. Offsite methods of
                 construction which involve building in a factory environment,
                 have been suggested as part of the solution to this issue.
                 Within the current economic context, this thesis focussed on
                 timber systems and examined the existing literature relating to
                 their Multi-Factor Productivity (MFP) measurements, identifying
                 a gap in knowledge relating to comparative MFP index for
                 different offsite timber systems. A subsequent market
                 perception survey amongst built environment professionals
                 highlighted an opportunity for offsite timber systems to
                 increase efficiency. However the responses indicated the
                 importance of examining advanced offsite timber systems such as
                 Volumetric Timber Construction (VTC) in comparison to
                 established in the UK market panelised timber systems. A
                 manufacturing survey was then undertaken which compared the
                 productivity ofVTC manufacturers in the UK and mainland Europe
                 with open and closed timber panel manufacturing techniques in
                 the UK. The main findings from the survey were that the
                 European VTC and UK panelised manufacturers had similarly high
                 productivity and the UKVTC manufacturers had potential for
                 growth. The MFP of four timber construction projects was then
                 analysed: two low-rise residential projects (using open timber
                 panel and VTC), and two mid-rise residential developments (one
                 using closed timber panels and one using cross laminated
                 timber). The results revealed that increased offsite completion
                 in the factory could result in increased construction
                 productivity however external and internal works were still a
                 major challenge to efficiency. The overall analysis was used to
                 outline a theoretical framework for an innovative MFP index
                 with five key quantified variables and five secondary
                 qualitative variables. This index facilitates the measurement
                 and comparison of construction productivity between a variety
                 of different structural systems and is one of the unique
                 contributions to knowledge generated in this thesis.},

  abstract     = {High dropout rates, delay, and dissatisfaction among PhD
                  students are common problems in doctoral education. Research
                  shows that many different factors are associated with doctoral
                  success, but these factors have not often been studied
                  simultaneously. Moreover, characteristics of the PhD project
                  are mostly neglected. In this study, we investigate which
                  supervision, psychosocial, and project characteristics are
                  related to satisfaction, progress, and quit intentions in a
                  sample of 839 PhD candidates at a university in the
                  Netherlands. Results of regression analyses show that
                  experienced workload was negatively related to satisfaction
                  and progress and positively to quit intentions. The quality of
                  the supervisor-PhD candidate relationship, the PhD candidate?s
                  sense of belonging, the amount of freedom in the project, and
                  working on a project closely related to the supervisor?s
                  research were positively related to satisfaction and
                  negatively to quit intentions. The high workload of PhD
                  candidates should be a major point of attention for
                  universities who wish to increase their rates of PhD
                  completion and PhD candidates? satisfaction. In addition, the
                  ?match? between PhD candidate and supervisor is crucial, both
                  personally ? a good relationship ? and academically, i.e. that
                  the PhD candidate works on a topic closely related to the
                  supervisor?s research.},

                  a simplistic four stage cycle which is attributed to Kolb
                  (1984). However, it will be demonstrated in this article that
                  this is a misinterpretation of Kolb's theory which results in
                  a limited view of 'experience' within experiential learning.
                  It is argued that not only a deeper understanding of Kolb's
                  original theory is required, but a return must be made to John
                  Dewey, perhaps the architect of experiential learning, to
                  fully comprehend its importance. In so doing, a fuller
                  appreciation of young people's experience is acquired, as well

  abstract     = {Purpose: The present study seeks to examine the efficacy of
                  different training modalities on increasing workplace
                  learning, representatives' intent to transfer what they
                  learned into their work, and importantly how training impacts
                  actual work performance. These relationships are tested in the
                  context of a Chinese division of a multinational
                  pharmaceutical company, where pharmaceutical representatives
                  are tasked with relaying relevant efficacy and safety
                  information on pharmaceutical products to health care
                  professionals who prescribe them to patients. Methods: The
                  present study employed a three-group between-subjects
                  experimental design. Representatives received varying forms of
                  training (instruction only, instruction plus reflection, and
                  instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback) based on
                  experimental conditions. After three training sessions over
                  the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on how
                  much they learned in the training and their actual work
                  performance through observer assessment of meetings with
                  health care professionals, facilitated by the representatives.
                  Findings: In this study, it was found that the process of
                  actively reflecting on what was learned in training led to
                  increased learning, as well as increased performance, compared
                  to simply studying the material. However, receiving direct
                  feedback on training performance, combined with active
                  reflection training, did not provide any further benefits in
                  terms of learning or work performance. Notably, there were no
                  differences in intent to transfer learned material to work, as
                  all conditions reported high levels of transfer intention.
                  Conclusion: The finding provides insightful evidence to
                  support the benefits of fostering trainees' active reflections
                  for work-based learning in the Chinese industry training
                  scenario. In contrast, receiving direct comments on how
                  students performed from a manager or trainer, as well as
                  advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
                  increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of
                  direct feedback is not statistically significant in this
                  context, further research should be done in understanding
                  individuals' thoughts and behaviors when received direct
                  feedbacks received in workplace training. Relatively little
                  workplace research has assessed both workplace learning and
                  performance in the same study, specifically in the Chinese
                  context. While training efficacy likely varies across cultures
                  to begin with, compensation structures in China do not provide
                  the same monetary incentives for workplace learning (i.e.
                  chance to increase income) as Western culture. This means that
                  any way to increase workplace learning should be of extra
                  value, as employees otherwise may not engage in it at all.},

               of human agency in work contexts based on a larger literature
               review. In a first step, two conceptually different perspectives
               of human agency are discussed: (a) agency as something
               individuals do and (b) agency as a personal feature of
               individuals. Both perspectives are then integrated into a larger
               framework also including situation-specific context factors. In a
               second step, three distinct components of human agency as a
               personal feature of individuals are derived and discussed: (a)
               agency competence (i.e. the capacity to visualise desired future
               states, to set goals based on these states, to translate these
               goals into actions, to engage in these actions, and to deal with
               upcoming problems), (b) agency beliefs (i.e. perceptions of
               whether one is agentically competent or not), and (c) agency
               personality (i.e. a stable and comparable situation-unspecific
               inclination to make choices and to engage in actions based on
               these choices with the aim to take control over one’s life or
               environment). In a third step, the results of this theoretical
               discussion are then used to propose an operational definition of

               at the identification of personal and/or situational factors that
               contribute to PhD candidates’ attrition and persistence,
               respectively. By doing so, the literature has adopted a rather
               passive perspective towards PhD candidates and their development.
               The active role of candidates being agentic constructors of their
               academic career has been widely neglected. This study therefore
               focuses on how PhD students can take an active approach towards
               their academic development. A qualitative interview study with
               ten German faculty members was conducted to answer the following
               research questions: (1) How do supervisors conceptualise academic
               success of PhD students? (2) How does professional agency affect
               academic success of young researchers? (3) What individual and/or
               contextual factors affect the exercise of professional agency?
               Based on these interviews, evidence is reported on how doctoral
               candidates can indeed affect their academic development and
               eventually their success by exercising professional agency. Among
               others, the study participants mentioned proactive networking,
               negotiation of external demands and deliberate information and
               feedback seeking as important manifestations of professional

  abstract     = {Purpose Industry 4.0 is assumed to yield extensive
                  industry-spanning opportunities. However, exploiting these
                  opportunities requires a targeted implementation of Industry
                  4.0. The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper
                  understanding of relevant implementation action. Existing
                  recommendations are mostly general, highly aggregated and
                  difficult to grasp. Yet, specific and concrete actions that
                  need to be taken to accelerate the realization of Industry 4.0
                  are essential.Design/methodology/approach The article uses 13
                  semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
                  empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers
                  from Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies.
                  All interviews are analyzed using qualitative content
                  analysis.Findings The study reveals relevant and targeted
                  aspects for Industry 4.0 implementation: the development of
                  Industry 4.0-specific know-how, securing financial resources,
                  integrating employees into the implementation process and
                  establishing an open-minded and flexible corporate culture.
                  Further aspects include comprehensive planning processes,
                  cooperation with external partners, proper handling of data
                  interfaces, interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable
                  organizational structure and data security.Research
                  limitations/implications The paper is limited to German
                  manufacturing enterprises and should be transferred to other
                  industries and countries.Practical implications The study
                  supports managers to effectively implement Industry 4.0 within
                  their organizations and consequently benefit from Industry 4.0
                  and derives recommendations for future
                  research.Originality/value The paper is among the first to
                  give specific and concrete examples for lessons learned from
                  Industry 4.0 implementation, directly obtained from industrial

                 projects requires a clear understanding of how the stages and
                 players involved interrelate. From the inception of the project
                 onwards, information is generated which is then required to be
                 adapted and communicated through the various stages to the
                 individuals involved so as to complete the project. Of these
                 stages, the design has always been recognised as important but,
                 in project management terms, not easily managed. The activities
                 involved in designing are complex and there is a need to employ
                 the services of an increasing number of specialists. This
                 research uses the framework developed in Business Process
                 Re-engineering (BPR) to establish the existing process involved
                 in developing and managing the design. An important element of
                 the building, the façade, is used as an example of what happens
                 more generally and the research is based on an in-depth case
                 study approach of four UK construction projects. To deal with
                 the quantity and quality of the qualitative data, the
                 methodology of cognitive mapping is used to first create, and
                 then analyse, the perceptions of key decision makers involved
                 in the creation and management of the design. Using computer
                 based analytical tools the data is filtered through a number of
                 stages to produce summaries of the process of design. The
                 results of the research identify the need for the communication
                 of the key project objectives, together with the formation of a
                 strategy for achieving these objectives, at the outset.
                 Selection of the right individuals, at the right time will
                 significantly increase the development of the team approach,
                 which is necessary to successfully develop the design. Finally,
                 the use of formalised reviews can ensure that design progresses
                 so as to meet the project objectives.},

                  increasingly limits firm-level abilities to identify and
                  pursue systemic innovation opportunities. Recent research
                  identifies how integration strategies enable individual
                  projects to break from this trap, but much less is known about
                  potential strategic action of firms to enable systemic
                  innovation. To explore this, a longitudinal comparative case
                  study examines how three entrepreneurial firms ? DPR
                  construction, RAD Urban, and Project Frog ? in the San
                  Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic evolution and
                  restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five years to
                  enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each firm
                  has developed a different approach ? relational, project-based
                  spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems integration.
                  Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The
                  approaches are theorized as a form of strategic
                  mirror-breaking intended to redefine the current paradigm of
                  knowledge and task dependencies. They enable the firms to
                  develop products with new system architectures and access more
                  opportunities for innovation in digitally-enabled
                  manufacturing. The paper concludes with discussion of how the
                  identification and characterization of strategies for
                  mirror-breaking enriches understanding of integration for
                  systemic innovation in construction at the firm level. The
                  paper identifies common themes for digitally-enabled
                  manufacturing including the limitations of the current
                  industry structure, the emergence of new hybrid positions, and
                  the opportunity for platforms to provide longitudinal
                  integration.},

                 construction sector productivity. This decline in such a large
                 sector has had a material effect on secular productivity growth
                 for the economy as a whole. Prior work has focused on the role
                 of potential measurement problems in construction, particularly
                 output deflators in the measurement of productivity. This paper
                 brings some new evidence to bear on the industry’s measured
                 productivity problems and suggests that measurement error is
                 probably not the sole source of the stagnation. First, using
                 measures of physical productivity in housing construction,
                 productivity is falling or, at best, stagnant over multiple
                 decades. Second, there has been a noticeable decline over time
                 in the efficiency with which construction firms translate
                 materials inputs into output, and a corresponding shift toward
                 more value-added-intensive production. Third, using state-level
                 data, we do not find evidence of patterns of within-industry
                 reallocation that might be expected of efficiently operating
                 input and output markets. States with more productive
                 construction sectors do not see growth in their shares of total
                 U.S. construction activity; if anything, their shares fall.

               elites - and how we must reshape the path of innovation to create
               true shared prosperity.A thousand years of history and
               contemporary evidence make one thing clear. Progress is not
               automatic but depends on the choices we make about technology.
               New ways of organizing production and communication can either
               serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation
               for widespread prosperity.Much of the wealth generated by
               agricultural advances during the European Middle Ages was
               captured by the Church and used to build grand cathedrals while
               the peasants starved. The first hundred years of
               industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for
               workers, while making a few people very rich. And throughout the
               world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence
               increase inequality and undermine democracy through excessive
               automation, massive data collection, and intrusive
               surveillance.It doesn't have to be this way. Power and Progress
               demonstrates that the path of technology was once - and can again
               be - brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of
               the last half century can become empowering and democratizing
               tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a
               few hubristic tech leaders striving to build a society that
               elevates their own power and prestige.With their breakthrough
               economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and
               Johnson provide the understanding and the vision to reshape how
               we innovate and who really gains from technological advances so
               we can create real prosperity for all.},

              examples of policies, technologies and investments that support
              low-carbon building stocks. The key global buildings sector trends
              are: • Global buildings sector emissions increased 2\% from 2017
              to 2018, to reach a record high, while final energy demand rose
              1\% from 2017 and 7\% from 2010. • Increases were driven by strong
              floor area and population expansions. While efficiency
              improvements continued to be made, they were not adequate to
              outpace demand growth. • 2020 is a key year for countries to
              enhance their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs),

                  construction for residential homes. While modular home
                  construction has certain advantages in terms of material and
                  time efficiency, it requires a different infrastructure than
                  conventional home construction, and the overall environmental
                  trade‐offs between the two methods have been unclear. This
                  study uses life cycle assessment to quantify the environmental
                  impacts of constructing a typical residential home using the

  abstract     = {The construction industry is a significant source of waste
                  generation in any economy, producing various greenhouse gases,
                  releasing harmful substances into the natural environment, and
                  requiring large areas of land for processing, treatment, and
                  landfilling. The emerging field of off-site prefabrication and
                  assembly is perceived as a viable method to reduce waste and
                  improve sustainability. However, there is a lack of
                  quantifiable research into the difference between off-site
                  prefabrication and on-site, conventional construction for
                  numerous sustainability criteria. This paper focuses on
                  modular construction as an off-site production system, where a
                  framework to compare waste generation of modular and
                  conventional, in-situ construction methods is proposed. This
                  paper aims to quantify these differences. The framework relies
                  on a comprehensive literature review to estimate the waste
                  rates of building materials, which are then applied to
                  realistic case studies in order to determine the differences
                  in waste generation. Overall, modular construction reduces the
                  overall weight of waste by up to 83.2\%, for the cases
                  considered. This corresponds to a 47.9\% decrease in the cost
                  of waste for large structures. Care must be taken to keep
                  modular wastage as low as possible for a reduced cost of waste
                  to be also present in smaller structures. This reduces the
                  research gap of quantifying the waste differences between
                  conventional and modular construction, and provides thoroughly
                  researched waste rates for future research, while also
                  improving the knowledge of industry stakeholders, informing
                  them of the benefits of modular construction. This allows
                  stakeholders to make more informed decisions when selecting an
                  appropriate construction method.},

  abstract     = {Prefabricated housing is a disruptive innovation struggling to
                  take hold in a traditional complex product system (CoPS). It
                  is quicker to produce and has improved environmental
                  performance compared to traditional housing. CoPS have more
                  dense and complex network connections than commodity
                  industries, making disruptive innovation more difficult.
                  Effective relational capabilities can achieve the coordination
                  necessary to address this challenge. The prefabricated housing
                  industry needs to develop a structure that drives these
                  capabilities. Using a case study methodology, the structure of
                  the industry is examined in two contrasting countries, namely
                  Australia and Sweden, as they represent an early and late
                  stage of industry emergence, respectively. A new framework is
                  proposed for this purpose, enabling a repeatable, orderly and
                  comprehensive disaggregation of industry structure to examine
                  the latent drivers of relational capability. The main
                  empirical contribution is to (1) describe an industry that is
                  yet to be formally recognized by national statistical agencies
                  and (2) show how the adoption of prefabricated housing can be
                  accelerated. The study found that younger industries need a
                  focused industry association with diverse membership to act as
                  an effective system integrator.},

                  to preferred ones. Practices of making futures are
                  increasingly online. Yet, as organizational participants come
                  together online ? organizing remotely to make offline futures
                  ? they lack the shared experiential knowledge that is gained
                  through embodied and situated practices. In this essay, we
                  argue that the lack of experiential knowledge makes future
                  making online difficult to organize and vulnerable to
                  excluding relevant expertise; dialogue may become
                  inward-looking and self-referential within the online
                  environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the
                  futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on
                  the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to
                  articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to
                  suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as

                  that proceeds through engagement with representations of the
                  future ? we identify three remedial actions for online future
                  making: to solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change
                  medium. These remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack
                  of shared experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online
                  involvement of heterogeneous remote participants and by
                  bringing in relevant (offline) places, people and materials to

  abstract     = {Firms modularize as they move into industrialized
                  construction. Prior research highlights the importance of
                  their modularization strategies, arguing that firms can either
                  build the competence for modularization internally or can
                  source them externally. To understand what shapes a firm?s
                  choice to use external competences in its modularization
                  strategy, we studied three leading construction firms. In this
                  multiple case study, Alpha, Beta and Gamma are leaders in
                  Asian markets, using reinforced concrete solutions in
                  high-rise industrialized construction. Where external
                  competences are available, our analyses show the work firms do
                  to make them reliable and that their choice to use external
                  competences is shaped by their reliability. Alpha modularized
                  in a context with little available external competences, so it
                  built new competences in-house; Beta chose to use the
                  externally available manufacturing and assembly competences,
                  using standards, remote monitoring and control of product
                  architectures to make them reliable for their use in
                  modularization; Gamma had available competences in the
                  external context and initially sought to use them, but
                  reliability concerns led to it modularizing by acquiring the
                  firms to bring these competences in-house. Our contribution is
                  to show how ensuring the reliability of external competences
                  shapes modularization strategies. Further, we have identified
                  actions that firms can adopt to make external competences
                  reliable through: (1) use of international standards, (2)
                  quality control procedures, (3) control of product
                  architectures, and 4) acquisition of external competences. We
                  provide implications for practitioners and policy makers
                  seeking to transition to industrialized construction; and

                  combined with the economic recession in the first decade of
                  the 21st century, have led to an increase in the proportion of
                  older workers in the US workplace. Understanding the health
                  and safety needs of an aging workforce will be critical,
                  especially in the construction industry, where physical job
                  demands are high. This paper reviews the epidemiologic
                  literature on the impact of age on injury among workers in the
                  construction industry in terms of cause, type, and cost.
                  PubMed was searched by using the following terms: older
                  workers, construction, construction industry, injury, and age.
                  The available studies reported that, among the construction
                  industry workforce, older age at injury was related to higher
                  injury costs but not to number of injuries. The higher injury
                  costs associated with worker age are likely due in part to the
                  severity of the injuries sustained by older workers.
                  Identification of injury trends and subsequent analytical
                  research efforts designed to ascertain factors associated with
                  injury among older construction workers are needed for
                  employers to effectively manage a health and safety program

               preserve American democracy back to World War II, when a handful
               of committed public servants and brave private citizens thwarted
               far-right plotters trying to steer our nation toward an alliance
               with the Nazis. “A ripping read—well rendered, fast-paced and
               delivered with the same punch and assurance that she brings to a
               broadcast. . . . The parallels to the present day are strong,
               even startling.”—The New York Times (Editors’ Choice)Inspired by
               her research for the hit podcast Ultra, Rachel Maddow charts the
               rise of a wild American strain of authoritarianism that has been
               alive on the far-right edge of our politics for the better part
               of a century. Before and even after our troops had begun fighting
               abroad in World War II, a clandestine network flooded the country
               with disinformation aimed at sapping the strength of the U.S. war
               effort and persuading Americans that our natural alliance was
               with the Axis, not against it. It was a sophisticated and
               shockingly well-funded campaign to undermine democratic
               institutions, promote antisemitism, and destroy citizens’
               confidence in their elected leaders, with the ultimate goal of
               overthrowing the U.S. government and installing authoritarian
               rule. That effort worked—tongue and groove—alongside an
               ultra-right paramilitary movement that stockpiled bombs and
               weapons and trained for mass murder and violent insurrection. At
               the same time, a handful of extraordinary activists and
               journalists were tracking the scheme, exposing it even as it was
               unfolding. In 1941 the U.S. Department of Justice finally made a
               frontal attack, identifying the key plotters, finding their
               backers, and prosecuting dozens in federal court. None of it went
               as planned. While the scheme has been remembered in history—if at
               all—as the work of fringe players, in reality it involved a large
               number of some of the country’s most influential elected
               officials. Their interference in law enforcement efforts against
               the plot is a dark story of the rule of law bending and then
               breaking under the weight of political intimidation. That failure
               of the legal system had consequences. The tentacles of that
               unslain beast have reached forward into our history for decades.
               But the heroic efforts of the activists, journalists,
               prosecutors, and regular citizens who sought to expose the
               insurrectionists also make for a deeply resonant, deeply relevant
               tale in our own disquieting times.},

                  effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
                  tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
                  one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of
                  tutoring. To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only
                  on the effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
                  effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as
                  well as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is
                  further tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of
                  tutoring tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to
                  promote a more interactive style of dialogue, rather than a
                  didactic style, tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Instead, tutors were encouraged to
                  prompt the students. Surprisingly, students learned just as
                  effectively even when tutors were suppressed from giving
                  explanations and feedback. Their learning in the interactive
                  style of tutoring is attributed to construction from deeper
                  and a greater amount of scaffolding episodes, as well as their
                  greater effort to take control of their own learning by

                  Systems (ITSs) tailors direction, support, and feedback to
                  enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge
                  or skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally
                  developed to support desktop training applications, with the
                  most common domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks
                  (e.g., mathematics and physics). In recent years,
                  implementations of game-based tutors authored using the
                  Generalized Intelligent Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an
                  open-source tutoring architecture, provided tailored training
                  experiences for military tasks through desktop applications
                  (e.g., games including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic).
                  However, these game-based desktop tutors have also been
                  limited to adaptive instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g.,
                  problem solving and decision-making). The military requires
                  adaptive instruction to extend beyond the desktop to be
                  compatible with the physical nature of many tasks performed by
                  soldiers, sailors, and airmen. This article examines how
                  commercial sensor technologies might be adapted to work with
                  GIFT and support tailored computer-guided instruction in the
                  psychomotor domain for a military medical training task,
                  specifically hemorrhage control. Toward this goal, we
                  evaluated the usability and system features of commercial
                  smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies. Smart glasses
                  were selected as the focus of this study over handheld mobile
                  devices in order to promote a hands-free experience during the
                  training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a mannequin. Pressure
                  sensors were selected to provide direct measures of
                  effectiveness during the application of tourniquets and
                  pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses and
                  pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
                  other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
                  adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s
                  point-of-need and criteria based on established usability
                  heuristics. Instruction in the wild is training provided in an
                  environment outside the classroom and areas where tracking and
                  sensing infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of
                  operation). We examined a wide range of features and
                  capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
                  hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question:
                  what system design features (e.g., usability and interaction)
                  are needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
                  psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no
                  formal training infrastructure is available?},

                 years. They have numerous potential applications including
                 recreation, security, and journalism, to name a few. Wearable
                 technologies such as body worn cameras pose a particular
                 challenge from a data protection perspective due to their
                 mobile nature. Unlike CCTV systems, which can be carefully
                 positioned to minimise the risk of inadvertent data collection,
                 a body worn camera can effectively turn the wearer into a
                 mobile surveillance system that is likely to capture the
                 personal data of passers-by. When this type of technology is
                 combined with microphones and/or facial recognition technology
                 the data protection concerns increase. This guidance is
                 intended to assist the users of these recording devices in

                  is far behind OSH in developed countries. From this
                  phenomenon, very important to minimize the level of accident
                  in the construction industry. According to experts that to
                  improve a safety performance can through education/training,
                  safety education must more developed in vocational school,
                  college, graduate school, and also in course in professional
                  association. One aspect of education development is to create
                  a model of learning/training as better as possible, and so
                  this research is conducted. The proposed model was the
                  learning/training of OSH based on industry in construction
                  industry. The research was quasi-experiment study, conducted
                  at 2011-2013 in the Civil Engineering Department, Semarang
                  State University. In this research, model that implementing
                  the industrial-based learning/training as the experimental
                  group, and the existing learning model as control group. The
                  data were collected through documentation, questionnaire,
                  observation, and test. The validity and reliability of
                  instrument was conducted through verification by experts and
                  practitioners, item difficulty analysis, and Cronbach's alpha.
                  The data were analyzed using normality test, homogeneity test,
                  T-test and F-test. The results: the proposed model has been
                  more effective compared to the existing learning model; the
                  proposed model can be used in learning/training of OSH in
                  construction industry for more effective result.},

  abstract     = {The construction industry is one of the sectors with the
                  highest accident rates. To prevent accidents, construction
                  workers receive occupational safety training and safety
                  instructions. However, experience-based learning of dangerous
                  situations is hardly possible or justifiable in reality.
                  Virtual reality (VR) simulations can be a potential solution
                  in this regard by allowing workers to experience dangerous
                  situations in a very vivid but safe way without being exposed
                  to real hazards. In this study, a VR simulation for
                  construction safety training was developed and tested with
                  trainees that learn the safe operation of hand-operated power
                  tools. In this particular case study, the objective for the
                  participants in the VR simulation was to successfully consider
                  all safety aspects in the operation of an angle grinder. The
                  usability, user experience and implicit learning were
                  investigated during the study. Additionally, we conducted
                  post-play interviews with participants. Results found learning
                  effects of participants as well as a satisfying user
                  experience and usability. The results also show that
                  participants might learn content as presented, risking the
                  learning of false information if the simulation does not cover
                  relevant safety aspects.},

  abstract     = {Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
                  have typically been tied to its capability to support
                  information structuring and exchange through the
                  centralization of information. Its increasing adoption and the
                  associated ease of data acquisition has created information
                  intensive work environments, which can result in information
                  overload and thus negatively impact workers task efficiency
                  during construction. Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed
                  as a mechanism to enhance the process of information
                  extraction from building information models to improve the
                  efficiency and effectiveness of workers' tasks. Yet, there is
                  limited research that has evaluated the effectiveness and
                  usability of AR in this domain. This research aims to address
                  this gap and evaluate the effectiveness of BIM and AR system
                  integration to enhance task efficiency through improving the
                  information retrieval process during construction. To achieve
                  this, a design science research approach was adopted that
                  enabled the development and performance of a mobile BIM AR
                  system (artefact) with cloud-based storage capabilities to be
                  tested and evaluated using a portable desktop experiment. A
                  total of 20 participants compared existing manual information
                  retrieval methods (control group), with information retrieval
                  through the artefact (non-control group). The results revealed
                  that the participants using the artefact were approximately
                  50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks, and
                  committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
                  This research demonstrates that a minor modification to
                  existing information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of
                  Quick Response markers can significantly improve the
                  information retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration
                  has the potential to enhance task efficiency.},

                  proven to be more effective in delivering learning materials
                  to students. Video games have been introduced as one of the
                  possible new tools for educating the upcoming generation in
                  many different fields. Specifically, construction management
                  education has attempted to use simulation software to
                  introduce students to various construction concepts. However,
                  these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to the

                  needed to enhance the construction management educational
                  experience. One of these new methods is showing real time
                  videos that highlight the various elements of concern in the
                  classroom lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use
                  augmented reality technology (ART) and a layer of artificial
                  visualizations to simulate the environmental context and
                  spatio-temporal constraints of various construction processes.
                  The superimposition of images serves as an instructional
                  mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into
                  classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints
                  enables learners to visualize context and hidden processes
                  otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom lectures.
                  Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
                  perception of reality is created through the combination of
                  the learners’ ability to understand the complexity of
                  construction products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite
                  processes by viewing the real environment augmented with
                  computer-generated information layers. Findings Testing the
                  ART video in a classroom with undergraduate construction
                  management students showed that students who were exposed to
                  the ART video were able to remember and identify the
                  highlighted elements in the corresponding assembly more
                  effectively than those who were not. Originality/value ART is
                  a valuable tool in enhancing classroom learning and gives
                  educators a teaching advantage when they combine traditional
                  classroom lectures with ART enabled media.},

                  placing it in its theoretical-historical context. The paper
                  discusses the connection between Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal
                  Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and
                  explicates the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds.
                  The paper then presents a discussion of the changes that the
                  notion of scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes
                  to supporting students in classroom contexts. In classrooms
                  where one teacher supports multiple students, scaffolding is
                  distributed across various tools and social scaffolds. A
                  discussion of the notion of distributed scaffolding is
                  presented, to describe how students in classrooms may be
                  supported by various tools and social scaffolds. The paper
                  then introduces the kinds of distribution and interactions
                  between tools and social scaffolds that need to be considered
                  to support multiple students in classroom contexts. Finally,
                  distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to the key

                  frequently translated as 'learning', more accurately indicates
                  the interaction of teacher and student. Although the various
                  domains (phylogenesis, sociocultural history, ontogenesis, and
                  microgenesis) to which Vygotsky extended the concept of
                  development have differing dynamics, the course of development
                  within each domain is characterized by the transformative
                  effects of cultural tools (mediational means) upon their
                  users. Vygotsky posited a form of abstract rationality

                  inherent in all human languages, as an ideal endpoint (telos)
                  of development. Evidence that Vygotsky at times assumed the

               of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest form is
               perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The great
               philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that the
               possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: “A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.” A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: “he could [in any case] not be as strong as a mule.”
               Moral perfection is the third, “the highest degree of excellency
               in man’s character.” Of this perfection Maimonides says: “Imagine
               a person being alone, and having no connection whatever with any
               other person; all his good moral principles are at rest, they are
               not required and give man no perfection whatever. These
               principles are only necessary and useful when man comes in
               contact with others.” “The fourth kind of perfection is the true
               perfection of man; the possession of the highest intellectual
               faculties . . . .” In justification of his assertion, this
               extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges: “Examine the
               first three kinds of perfection; you will find that if you
               possess them, they are not your property, but the property of
               others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is exclusively
               yours; no one else owns any part of it.”},

                  including institutional arrangements and recent innovations to
                  cope with the challenging characteristics of construction
                  labor markets. Design/methodology/approach Statistical
                  comparisons by type of program sponsor are carried out using
                  individual‐level data on registered apprenticeship for the
                  period 1996‐2003. Evolution of apprenticeship programs is
                  discussed in a historical perspective. Findings Joint programs
                  (with union participation) were found to have much higher
                  enrolments and greater participation of women and
                  ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit markedly
                  better performance for all groups on rates of attrition and
                  completion. Joint programs have developed various innovations,
                  including college credit for training and scholarship loans to
                  expand apprenticeship and improve quality and retention,
                  although there are no quantitative evaluations of the
                  effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
                  limitations/implications Statistical information includes
                  about 65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA.
                  Practical implications The paper shows that alternative forms
                  of training sponsorship have substantially different effects
                  on enrolment and graduation. Identification of the practices,
                  that improve enrolment and retention, and their widespread
                  adoption would enhance the effectiveness of training programs.
                  Originality/value The dataset used in this paper has not yet
                  been used in any publications. The findings regarding joint
                  programs are notable, in view of the skilled labor shortages
                  facing the construction industry in the USA.},

                  To prevent networks from overfitting and improve their

                  implemented and compared. The results proved a better

                  stopping. To demonstrate the prediction performance of the
                  presented models, the developed models are implemented at two

                  processes, where the size of the design is strictly
                  constrained by the chamber volume of the 3D printer. This
                  issue is more pronounced in the building and construction
                  industry, where it is impractical to have printers that are
                  larger than actual buildings. One workaround consists in
                  printing smaller pieces, which can then be assembled on-site.
                  This workaround generates however additional design and
                  process complexities, as well as creates potential weaknesses
                  at the assembly interfaces. In this paper, we propose a 3D

               the persona concept. Comparing to the primary idea of persona,
               this paper explores some manners with which practitioners
               actually utilize persona in their work, which has not been
               emphasized in-depth in current literatures. Our findings provide
               an initial step showing how practitioners in a creative way
               develop various usages of personas in practice. We believe this
               research not only expands the understanding of personas in
               design, but also gives insights about how practicing designers
               adapt and make design "tools" their own.},

                  designers with glimpses into the local cultures for which they

                  HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more
                  deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions
                  where they work, in designing technologies that are not
                  strictly related to socioeconomic development, and in
                  considering new design approaches. However, few use this
                  subjective, design-led method in their research. In this
                  paper, I present a case study detailing my experience
                  designing and deploying cultural probes in Bungoma, Kenya.
                  Returns from my comment cards and digital camera activities
                  draw attention to probe recipients' unique experiences and to
                  Bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they also inspired a
                  series of speculative design proposals. My experience
                  motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a cultural
                  probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by raising
                  questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the pursuit

               done 'for', 'with' or 'by' the users based on the assumption that
               users were real people. Today 'users' have become a component in
               mass-market production and are seen as 'customers', rather than
               people. Still designers need to address use, and personas have
               been introduced for this purpose. The paper uses research on user
               participation and research-based personas from the eGov+ project
               to discuss whether personas help designers engage with users. In
               this project, design was carried out in the domain of municipal
               services through involvement of clerks, management and citizens
               from three different municipalities. Through four cases we
               discuss if applying personas in participatory design settings is
               productive to designers' understanding of users' use situations.
               Does deployment of personas bring designers closer to the actual
               use situation? In which ways do personas help design for, with or
               by the users? Do personas support participatory design?},

               Agency is understood as a multifaceted construct describing the
               idea that human beings make choices, act on these choices, and
               thereby exercise influence on their own lives as well as their
               environment. We argue that the concept is discussed from three
               different perspectives in the literature—transformational,
               dispositional, and relational—that are each related to learning
               and development in work contexts. These perspectives do not
               reflect incompatible positions but rather different aspects of
               the same phenomena. The chapter also offers an avenue of insight
               into empirical studies that employ agency as a central concept as
               well as discussions about concepts that closely overlap with
               ideas of human beings as agents of power and influence.},

                   field, eye tracking technology is being applied more
                   frequently in cognitive research such as hazard
                   identification. These studies typically use eye tracking in a
                   diagnostic way and pay less attention to the application of
                   virtual environment. However, in virtual environment, eye
                   tracking not only can enhance the study of the cognitive
                   process but also improves the human-computer interaction.
                   Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye tracking
                   devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
                   diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the
                   existing research gaps of using eye tracking in the
                   construction industry. Then, we follow 3D object
                   identification, diagnostic mode and interactive mode to
                   develop a methodology by HTC VIVE device with Pupil Labs HTC
                   Vive Binocular Add-on based on the research gaps. Finally, an
                   example experiment is provided to demonstrate studying hazard
                   identification using eye tracking in construction safety. For
                   analyzing the eye movement data from the participants, we
                   offer the number of confirmations, the scan path and the 3D
                   heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic construction
                   site scenes. This paper provides an approach of applying eye
                   tracking to gather more data in virtual environment for the
                   future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to
                   improve human-computer interaction using eye tracking in the
                   construction industry.},

                  Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development could be used to
                  inform the design of an Interactive Learning Environment
                  called the Ecolab. Two aspects of this work have subsequently
                  been used for further research. Firstly, there is the
                  interpretation of the ZPD and its associated theory that was
                  used to operationalize the ZPD so that it could be implemented
                  in software. This interpretation has informed further research
                  about how one can model context and its impact on learning,
                  which has produced a design framework that has been
                  successfully applied across a range of educational settings.
                  Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The software
                  has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
                  supported explorations into how to scaffold learners’
                  metacognition, how to scaffold learners’ motivation and the
                  implications of a learner’s goal orientation upon their use of
                  the software. The findings from these studies have informed
                  our understanding of learner scaffolding and have produced
                  consistent results to demonstrate the importance of providing
                  learners with appropriately challenging tasks and flexible
                  support. Vygotsky’s work is as relevant now as it was in 1999:
                  it still has an important role to play in the development of
                  educational software.},

                  it builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences,
                  computer science, education, and the social sciences. We
                  define learning at scale as the study of the technologies,
                  pedagogies, analyses, and theories of learning and teaching
                  that take place with a large number of learners and a high
                  ratio of learners to facilitators. The scale of these
                  environments often changes the very nature of the interaction
                  and learning experiences. We identify three types of
                  technologies that support scale in education: dedicated
                  content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs; dedicated tools,
                  such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and repurposed
                  platforms, such as social networks. We further identify five
                  areas that scale affects: learners, research and data,
                  adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the
                  papers in this special issue on the topic, we discuss the
                  characteristics, affordances, and promise of learning at
                  scale.},

  abstract     = {This article is a review of experiments comparing the
                  effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
                  tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the
                  same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems
                  were divided by their granularity of the user interface
                  interaction into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based
                  tutoring systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have
                  step-based or substep-based granularities of interaction,
                  whereas most other tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or
                  CAL systems) have answer-based user interfaces. It is widely
                  believed as the granularity of tutoring decreases, the
                  effectiveness increases. In particular, when compared to No
                  tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring systems,
                  intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are
                  believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review
                  did not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the
                  effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79.
                  Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems was
                  0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.},

               Revolution) curriculum within secondary education. Across the UK,
               there is currently no systematic pedagogical design or evaluation
               to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning to include 4IR
               skills and knowledge. There is also no clear national strategy
               for schools and FE colleges to follow in how to embed 4IR,
               including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and Internet of
               Things tools, skills and understanding into their teaching. Such
               a lack of an evidence-based research study impacts our young
               students in particular and education system in general, and
               further discriminates against disadvantaged and digitally
               excluded groups. We applied a design-based research methodology
               framework and worked with two London based schools to co-design
               and deliver a series of workshops to 13-14-year-old students
               introducing them to 4IR skills through engaging practical
               activities. Within the pilot study we engaged with both
               co-designers and students to capture opinion, understanding,
               learning and enjoyment before, during and after the workshops.
               The significance of this paper is twofold; to identify lessons
               learnt in developing 4IR skills and knowledge within the
               curriculum and to share the insights of the adults and young
               learners throughout the project.},

                  identified as important technologies that could reimagine
                  spatial information delivery and enhance higher education
                  practice. However, there is limited research on the impact of
                  mobile MR (MMR) within construction education and improvement
                  of the learners’ experience. With new building information
                  modelling (BIM) workflows being adopted within the
                  architecture, engineering and construction industry,
                  innovative MMR pedagogical delivery methods should be explored
                  to enhance this information-rich spatial technology workflow.
                  This paper outlines qualitative results derived through
                  thematic analysis of learner reflections from two
                  technology-enhanced lessons involving a lecture and a hands-on
                  workshop focussed on MMR-BIM delivered within postgraduate
                  construction education. Seventy participants across the two
                  lessons recruited from an Australian university participated
                  to answer the research question: ‘Does applied mobile mixed
                  reality create an enhanced learning environment for students?’
                  The results of the analysis suggest that using MMR-BIM can
                  result in an enhanced learning environment that facilitates
                  unique learning experiences, engagement and motivation.
                  However, the study outcome suggests that to understand the
                  processes leading to these learning aspects, further empirical
                  research on the topic is required. This paper is part of the

                  student knowledge assessment method. It is widely used in
                  intelligent tutoring systems. In the standard BKT model, all
                  knowledge and skills are independent of each other. However,
                  in the process of student learning, they have a very close
                  relation. A student may understand knowledge B better when he
                  masters knowledge A. Therefore, this work introduces a new
                  student model based on BKT. It takes the relationship between
                  knowledge into account. By doing this, the new model proves
                  higher prediction accuracy and performs better. Then this
                  paper uses the new model to make a cognitive diagnosis
                  according to students? test scores. The diagnostic results can

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTArtificial intelligence (AI) has been widely explored
                  across the world over the past decades. A particularly
                  emerging topic is the application of AI in e-learning (AIeL)
                  to improve the effectiveness of teaching and learning in
                  precision education. This study aims to systematically review
                  publication patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading
                  journals, countries, disciplines, and applications. In
                  addition, a co-citation network analysis was conducted to
                  explore the invisible relationships among the core papers of
                  AIeL to reveal directions for future research. The analysis is
                  based on a total of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149
                  citations in follow-up studies obtained from the Web of
                  Science. It was found that a majority of AIeL studies focused
                  on the development and applications of intelligent tutoring
                  systems, followed by using AI to facilitate assessment and
                  evaluation in e-learning contexts. For field researchers, the
                  visualized network diagram serves as a map to explore the
                  invisible relationships among the core AIeL research,
                  providing a structural understanding of AI-supported research
                  in e-learning contexts. A further investigation of the
                  follow-up studies behind the highly co-cited links revealed
                  the extended research directions from the AIeL mainstreams,
                  such as adaptive learning-based evaluation environments.
                  Implications are discussed.},

                  promising way to prepare high school students for the world of
                  work, it is unclear how many workplace simulations exist and
                  how suitable they are for school-to-work programs. An
                  extensive survey located 142 workplace simulations, many of
                  which were not intended for the school-to-work market.
                  Thirty-nine of the most promising simulations were obtained
                  and analyzed to determine potential problems that might impede
                  their use in school-to-work programs. These simulations were
                  classified according to type (e.g., Skill simulations;
                  Role-Playing simulations; and Strategy simulations) and then
                  critiqued regarding common problems in using them (e.g.,
                  usability, learnability, content, and available teacher
                  support). We indicate which problems are most common and what
                  educators can do to overcome them. We close with a
                  propositional analysis of two of the most promising workplace
                  simulations that measures the job-specificity and implicitness
                  of their content. We conclude that simulations can play an
                  important role in school-to-work transition programs, even if
                  not specifically designed for that purpose.},

                  discrete? in architecture, speculating on how an integrated
                  approach to design, fabrication, assembly and inhabitation can
                  disrupt the traditional investment- and decision-making models
                  in the housing industry. Strategically designed part-to-whole
                  systems allow for differentiation and reconfiguration, and the
                  incorporation of different end-user? requirements. This
                  potential of ?democratising? housing production requires
                  further research into how the negotiation between multiple
                  stakeholders? preferences can be guided through digital
                  methods. This paper presents a research-by-design project that

                  housing in Hong Kong, a typology which often features high
                  degrees of standardisation. Through the development of an
                  adaptable modular construction system and a multi-objective
                  optimisation workflow, a system is explored that addresses the
                  challenges of high-rise construction, and of customising
                  high-density housing. The case study project demonstrates the
                  ability of the workflow?s evolutionary algorithm to balance
                  complex requirements including maximising views, daylight
                  access and internal connectivity according to diverse user

                  기능 인력의 고령화에 따른 생산성 저하 등 양적, 질적인 문제를 동시에 겪고 있다. 여기에 현재 계획되고 있는
                  대규모 국가사업으로 향후 건설현장 기능 인력의 부족은 더욱 심각해질 전망이다. 건설현장 기능인력 수급 불균형
                  문제에 대한 해결방안으로서의 공급 확보 정책은 시대의 흐름과 기술 발전에 따른 미래 전망을 고려해볼 때, 어느
                  정도 한계가 있다고 판단되며, 기술적 접근을 통해 기능 인력에 대한 수요를 줄이는 노력이 병행되어야 한다고
                  판단된다. 기술 발전을 통한 기능인력 수요 감소를 위해서는 현장에서 수행되는 작업 프로세스의 생산성과 효율성을
                  향상시킬 수 있는 분야에 연구의 초점이 맞춰져야 하며, 기능인력 수요 저감의 핵심이 되며 연구개발 노력이 필요한
                  분야로서 1) 건설 자동화 및 기계화 확대를 통한 기능 인력의 대체, 2) 고성능 건설 자재 개발 및 활용으로
                  현장 작업량 저감, 3) 정보화 기술 도입으로 현장 작업대기 시간 감축에 의한 생산성 향상, 4) 모듈화,
                  선조립, 공장제작 등 선작업 방식의 적용을 통한 현장 기능 인력 수요 저감 및 생산성 향상, 5) 재설계/재시공
                  예방으로 추가 작업 발생 방지, 6) 기능 및 직종 통합에 의한 다기능 인력 양성, 7) 시공 프로세스 개선에
                  의한 작업 생산성 향상 등의 7가지 주제를 제시하였다. Labor shortages are a serious
                  problem for Korea's construction industry. The problem is both
                  quantitative and qualitative. There is a shortage in supply as
                  due to a decrease in the influx of new labor, and existing
                  workers are less productive as they age. The problem will only
                  get worse as more and more major public projects are being
                  planned. Options for increasing the labor supply are somewhat
                  limited, and thus efforts need to be made to adopt new
                  technologies that can improve the productivity and efficiency
                  of field work and their processes. This paper introduces seven
                  innovation technologies that have the best potential to
                  increase productivity and thus reduce the burden of labor
                  shortage problems. These include 1) Substitution by use of
                  robotics and automation, 2) development and applications of
                  Innovative materials to reduce on site field work, 3) increase
                  in productivity through the implementation of Information
                  Technology, 4) improved productivity through the application
                  of modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of rework and
                  redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating labor
                  skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site
                  processes.},

  abstract     = {The construction industry is facing an unprecedented,
                  nationwide shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the
                  second largest employer in the country and according to a
                  Construction Industry Institute study 75\% of contractors are
                  experiencing labor shortages that are manifesting themselves
                  as cost overruns and/or schedule delays. This crisis has been
                  a long time coming and our current culture has not helped the
                  problem. Young people who don't go to college are seen as
                  "failures," and fewer native-born Americans want to work with
                  their hands, outdoors?at any wage. In fact a group of high
                  school students surveyed about attractive careers listed
                  construction 498th out of 500 possible occupations. Not only
                  does construction have an image problem, but also the
                  workforce composition of the future is largely minority and
                  women, a challenge for an industry that is dominantly and
                  traditionally white male. In order to face this labor shortage
                  head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill ? Change or
                  continue to accept increases in project cost and duration. In
                  response to this challenge, several contractors and
                  construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
                  programs to recruit more individuals to the construction
                  trades, including charter schools, community outreach and
                  active participation in high school career guidance by
                  apprenticeship programs. More construction companies are
                  realizing that diversity practices add economic value to their
                  customers. They are establishing mentoring programs for
                  minority and women contractors and employing consulting firms
                  to assist them in acquiring these new cultural competencies.
                  Other firms are focusing their efforts on creating a working
                  atmosphere that embraces a diverse workforce, complete with
                  worker training on how to effectively deal with the changing
                  workplace culture. What positive effects are these approaches
                  having on the overall problem? Should these individual efforts
                  to improve the image of construction and its thrust for
                  diversity be aligned? This paper will attempt to highlight the
                  successes that some programs have achieved and what new
                  innovations they invoked in their endeavors. Additionally, it
                  will address areas where the efforts could successfully be
                  combined.},

  abstract    = {The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest
                 challenges facing the construction industry. The Construction
                 Users Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their
                 workforce availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82
                 percent of the respondents reported experiencing work force
                 shortages on their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the
                 trend had worsened over the previous three years. One promising
                 solution to relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to
                 provide adequate and effective training. Many research efforts
                 on construction worker training have been conducted in the past
                 decade in order to address the need and benefits of
                 construction craft training. However, a quantitative analysis
                 of construction craft trainings benefits and costs from the
                 perspective of worker, project and company has rarely been
                 carried out. Providing quantifiable analysis regarding the
                 benefits and costs of training can help to solve the debate
                 existing in the industry regarding the value of craft labor
                 training and improve the effectiveness of craft training
                 programs. The research investigated existing major datasets
                 relevant with construction craft training developed by previous
                 research. Meanwhile, as part of this research, a craft director
                 training survey was administrated to measure training benefits
                 in productivity, turnover, absenteeism safety and rework, as
                 well as information such as core training subjects and common
                 barriers for training. The primary objective of the study is to
                 qualify the outcomes and effectiveness of strategies for
                 construction craft training. Four secondary objectives are
                 completed to help achieve the primary goal: (I) Identify the
                 major characteristics of construction training and major
                 factors affecting construction training; (II) Quantitatively
                 measure the outcomes of construction training on the individual
                 and project/company level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio
                 models based on the survey administrated by the study as well
                 as existing industry data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity
                 analysis to identify real multiskilling patterns among craft
                 workers in order to adopt multiskilling training strategies in
                 the construction industry.},

                 their 20s and 30s today have incomes no higher than the
                 previous generation at the same age and are worse off once
                 housing costs are considered. The wage gap between older and
                 younger workers has widened since the 2008 financial crisis and
                 shows no signs of closing. The outlook is uncertain, with young
                 people over-represented in jobs in sectors that are expected to
                 see lower employment growth in the long term, and vital
                 ‘stepping stone’ midskill jobs are in decline. So, as we emerge
                 from the pandemic, we must consider not simply what the impact
                 of the pandemic has been on young people since early in 2020,
                 but how well equipped they now are to face the future. Young
                 people we spoke to as part of this research overwhelmingly want
                 what previous generations wanted from work: secure, full-time
                 jobs with decent pay (at the real living wage) near where they
                 live. They also want to work with like-minded people, in jobs
                 and companies they believe in and that are well matched to
                 their skills and capabilities. If required, and with the right
                 support, they are willing to change career direction.
                 Nonetheless, they perceive that a lack of local jobs and
                 inequalities in local areas could hold them back from achieving
                 their aspirations.},

                  experienced by British unions since 1979. During that period,
                  union membership has declined over 20 percent and three

                  and the decline of the manufacturing sector, are likely to
                  have more lasting adverse effects. Unions are adopting various
                  strategies to try to counteract the decline of their
                  membership, including innovative organizing methods and
                  expanded services for members. The fate of the unions will
                  depend, the author concludes, on the success of those
                  strategies, changes in the British economy, and the Labour
                  Party's fortunes in future general elections.},

                  of challenges lately in the context of geostrategic forces
                  that are shaping our world. Recent technological changes,
                  combined with shifts in global economic power, accelerating
                  urbanization, and demographic changes have put pressure on the
                  VET to become more responsive to the needs of the labour
                  market and society. E-learning has been seen as an effective
                  way of improving the quality of teaching and learning in VET
                  schools due to its various forms. Nevertheless, there has been
                  some disagreement in the litearture on the advantages and
                  disadvantages of the use of of e-learning in VET. Besides,
                  some studies recently reported a decline in enthusiasm about
                  the effects of e-learning in companies. In order to closely
                  examine the effects of e-learning in VET, we conduct a
                  literature review. We then carry out a discussion of the pros
                  and cons with the aim of developing suggestions for the better
                  use of e-learning in VET. The results of the litearture review
                  show that learners and providers of e-learning benefit from it
                  in different ways. In order to minimise the risks involved in
                  using e-learning, a mixture of online and face-to-face events
                  could be used, and adjusted pedagogical concepts should be

  abstract     = {AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has
                  experienced significant disruption. Rapid technological
                  change, outsourcing and off shoring have beset manufacturing
                  resulting in a general and steady decline in manufacturing
                  employment. Despite this turbulence, there remains a strong
                  nostalgia for manufacturing resulting in frequent public
                  policy discussion about how best to revitalise the industry. A
                  popular view is that a strong manufacturing industry relies
                  upon an equally strong vocational, education and training
                  (VET) system to provide requisite skill needs. Given the
                  dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing industry do such
                  arguments still hold true? This paper considers this question
                  through an examination of what the revitalisation of US
                  manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
                  extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
                  system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
                  Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
                  secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
                  that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system
                  overlooks the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems
                  that evolve to address local skill needs. These micro skill
                  eco-systems open the prospects for skills and training
                  innovations to meet changing workforce needs in a changing
                  industry.},

               the students' behavior. This chapter begins by providing an
               overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The chapter comments on
               competing research goals in the field, followed by descriptions
               of two successful systems: (1) the Pittsburgh urban math project
               algebra tutor project and (2) the SHERLOCK project. These two
               systems are being deployed in real-world educational environments
               with substantial success. This chapter briefly describes the
               underlying theory and implementation of each system, to motivate
               later discussions. A description of the standard components in an
               intelligent tutoring system is also presented along with a
               discussion of human-computer interaction assessment issues unique

                  collaborative learning environments that adapt their
                  characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
                  feedback, to improve individual students’ collaborative
                  interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can
                  automatically assess student dialogue, model effective and
                  ineffective collaboration, and provide relevant support. While
                  there is evidence that ACLS can improve student learning,
                  little is known about why systems that incorporate ACLS are
                  effective. Does relevant support improve student interactions
                  by providing just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe
                  they are receiving relevant support feel more accountable for
                  the collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
                  interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
                  have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
                  high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant
                  (APTA). To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled
                  study that demonstrated that our system provided students with
                  more relevant support and was more effective at improving
                  student learning than parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our
                  contributions involve generalizable techniques for
                  implementing ACLS that can function adaptively and
                  effectively, and the finding that adaptive support does indeed
                  improve student learning because of the relevance of the
                  support.},

                  an estimate of the probability that the student has learned
                  each of the rules in the ideal model, in a process
                  calledknowledge tracing. The tutor presents an individualized
                  sequence of exercises to the student based on these
                  probability estimates until the student has ‘mastered’ each

                  electricians and tile workers. Further findings showed that
                  skilled labour shortage was caused by socio–economic
                  conditions, external forces, job attractiveness, job
                  characteristics, job satisfaction, industry limitations and
                  personal factors. Employees should be encouraged to develop
                  their trade competences and change their attitude to work,
                  while employers should build their manpower base through

                  analysis of survey and interview data show that teachers
                  engaged regularly in emotional support of students, and a
                  pedagogy of care was discernible in the ways teachers
                  described seeking out signals that the students’ needs were
                  being met online. However, technology mediated communication
                  made this more difficult in online teaching than face-to-face,
                  increasing teachers’ emotional labour. Teachers’ efforts to
                  achieve interaction with, and feedback from, students to
                  inform their teaching approach, incurred a heavy burden of
                  emotional labour that is insufficiently recognised or

                  the least privileged sections of the university workforce,
                  this study uncovers uncomfortable questions about the

  abstract     = {Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
                  major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
                  carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
                  the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
                  three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
                  explored spatial skills, but never in the context of
                  vocational education and training (VET). This study sheds
                  light on the level and evolution of spatial skills in the
                  initial vocational training of carpenter apprentices in
                  Switzerland. Methods In this study, 726 subjects (98 females)
                  who were either carpenter apprentices, apprentices of another
                  profession, or high school students, took a test on spatial
                  skills with three parts: mental rotation, paper folding, and
                  orthographic projections. The first two parts are widely used
                  tests for spatial skills, while the last one was specifically
                  designed to address the 2D-3D transition that is a core skill
                  of carpenters. Results Carpenter apprentices do have higher
                  spatial skills than would be expected given their general
                  school level. In particular, their spatial skills were found
                  to be similar to those of high school students and superior to
                  those of apprentices of another profession. Carpenters’
                  spatial skills improve over the course of their
                  apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
                  trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
                  carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
                  the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
                  Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
                  over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
                  skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
                  develop further solutions that encourage further improvement
                  of teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.},

                  specialised, upper-secondary vocational education (VE)
                  programmes in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates’
                  position in the labour market. The data are from three cohorts
                  of the Dutch VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months
                  after graduation. The programmes of the highest level—Level
                  4—of the school-based learning route are investigated. To
                  separate narrow from broad programmes, a novel criterion is
                  used, based on the argument that the match between education
                  and a job within a narrow programme’s occupational domain is
                  better than outside that domain and that, for a broad
                  programme, such a match does not differ significantly between
                  the programme’s domain and outside it. This study shows that
                  graduates from narrow education programmes have a less
                  favourable labour market position than graduates from broad
                  programmes. They have a greater chance of being unemployed and
                  are more often mismatched in their jobs, both horizontally and
                  vertically. They earn less in any case, particularly if their
                  job is outside their occupational domain or below their level.
                  They consequently experience worse career opportunities and
                  many are more dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this
                  problem, it would be better to focus on realising a shift in
                  the influx of students from narrow to broad education
                  programmes instead of broadening all narrow programmes.
                  Besides this shift to broader programmes, offering broad
                  variants of narrow programmes while maintaining the narrow,
                  specialist variants could be highly allocation efficient.},

  abstract     = {That so many employers in various sectors continue to train
                  apprentices despite incurring substantial costs can be taken
                  as prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
                  investment risk. The main downside in the English
                  apprenticeship system is that the overall levels of employer
                  engagement and training volumes are considered sub-optimal and
                  in reality there is a fine balance which can put the
                  performance of the firm and the wider economy at risk due to
                  insufficient skill development. This paper draws on data from
                  the Net Costs and Benefits of Training to Employers series of
                  studies (carried out between 1994 and 2012). Each of the
                  original studies consisted of case studies of employers in
                  particular sectors in which the costs associated with training
                  an apprentice were considered against the benefits employers
                  obtain through this activity during the training period. Data
                  in the original studies was collected in face-to-face
                  interviews with the employers. The data were aligned with an
                  accounting framework that captured the relevant costs and
                  benefits of apprenticeship training from the perspective of
                  the employer. Calculations were carried out to also indicate
                  the payback period (i.e. the period after training has taken
                  over which an employer could be expected to recoup any net
                  cost they had incurred). We present the most comprehensive
                  available estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to
                  employers in England to illustrate how costs vary across
                  sectors and how, for most employers, engaging in
                  apprenticeship training leaves them with a net cost at the end
                  of the training period. The extent of this net cost at the end
                  of the formal training period is found to vary substantially
                  by sector and level of apprenticeship and over time, in real
                  terms, the net costs of training have tended to increase
                  across all sectors. Employers reported a range of rationales
                  for training apprentices; from supply-led (e.g. where
                  participation was prompted by training providers offering it
                  for free) to more demand-led (e.g. where employers saw
                  apprenticeship as necessary for acquiring needed skills)
                  reasons. Employer sensitivity to various cost parameters
                  depended upon where on the supply- to demand-led continuum
                  they fell. Despite various policy changes since the mid-1990s,
                  employers’ engagement in apprenticeships in England has not
                  achieved a significant volume and there are still financial
                  risks attached to investing in this form of training. Even
                  with the latest reforms of funding and delivery embodied in
                  the move to apprenticeship standards and the introduction of
                  an employer levy, there is no guarantee that more employers
                  will be willing to train apprentices or that those who already
                  engage will train more. There is a need to consider various
                  ways of reducing employers’ risk without inducing unintended
                  behavioural changes that counter overall policy objectives.},

                  training's identity has been founded on four types of
                  characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical
                  and pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be
                  adequate to identify vocational education and training across
                  jurisdictions, and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook
                  and Stevenson seek for vocational education and training what
                  Rushbrook calls an ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet
                  such a quest may degenerate into essentialism, and in any case
                  is vulnerable to being made obsolete by the changes that
                  vocational education and training is meant to be stimulating
                  and to equip us for life. The article concludes by arguing for
                  a definition of vocational education and training which is a
                  compound of the four general characteristics considered.},

                  Bohemian Region near the town of Ostrov (Czech Republic),
                  archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well
                  lining with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in
                  height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers,
                  studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating
                  were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55
                  BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically
                  dated archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the
                  third well from the Early Neolithic period that has been
                  discovered in the Czech Republic within the last four years.
                  The design consists of grooved corner posts with inserted
                  planks. This type of construction reveals advanced technical
                  know-how and, till now, is the only known type from this
                  region and time period. Thanks to the combination of annually
                  resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs), the
                  Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back
                  to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from
                  the well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel
                  (Corylus spp.), indicating a local forest composition
                  dominated by these taxa. The shape of the individual
                  structural elements and tool marks preserved on their surface
                  confirm sophisticated carpentry skills. Based on these
                  observations, we established a model for the “chaîne
                  opératoire” from forest utilization to the final artefact at
                  the beginning of the Early Neolithic period.},

                  engineered timber product of global interest. The orthogonal,
                  laminar structure allows its application as a full-size wall
                  and floor element as well as a linear timber member, able to
                  bear loads in- and out-of-plane. This article provides a
                  state-of-the-art report on some selected topics related to
                  CLT, in particular production and technology, characteristic
                  material properties, design and connections. Making use of
                  general information concerning the product’s development and
                  global market, the state of knowledge is briefly outlined,
                  including the newest findings and related references for
                  background information. In view of ongoing global activities,
                  a significant rise in production volume within the next decade
                  is expected. Prerequisites for the establishment of a solid
                  timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
                  comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
                  load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on
                  the properties of the base material board, enabling relatively
                  fast use of local timber species and qualities, and (3) the
                  development of CLT adequate connection systems for economic
                  assembling and an increasing degree of utilization regarding
                  the load-bearing potential of CLT elements in the joints. The
                  establishment of a worldwide harmonized package of standards
                  is recommended as this would broaden the fields of application
                  for timber engineering and strengthen CLT in competition with
                  solid-mineral based building materials.},

  abstract     = {The building and construction sector is a large contributor to
                  anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the
                  vastest amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
                  hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
                  construction are of fundamental importance for national and
                  global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
                  mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using
                  less of the same material) and substitution (using a different
                  material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
                  focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
                  floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
                  innovative, does not require any technological development nor
                  upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
                  immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We
                  combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment
                  across both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for
                  different levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction
                  in the next 30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas
                  emissions saving potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e
                  (95\% confidence interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e
                  in the case of full uptake of the hybrid construction system
                  by 2050. Our analysis does not account for carbon
                  sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
                  savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a
                  1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions
                  generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
                  non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
                  net-zero carbon buildings.},

  abstract     = {CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                  effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                  because their training has not fully prepared them to do so.
                  To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                  systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                  'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                  learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                  information, to use resources effectively and innovatively,
                  and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving
                  in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have
                  developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to
                  measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as
                  what they are able to learn in the present. More recently,
                  researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether
                  and how trainees take action to gain the information they need
                  to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging
                  metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design
                  instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities.
                  Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current
                  evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive
                  failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where
                  trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct
                  instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates
                  challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip
                  trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation
                  for future learning and the associated capacity of being
                  adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                  practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                  assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                  explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in
                  the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction
                  for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours
                  that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential
                  sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to
                  learn from their daily practice.},

               while creating paper based sketches motivated the development of

                  the gamification of virtual assembly planning on the user
                  performance, user experience and
                  engagement.Design/methodology/approach A multi-touch table was
                  used to manipulate virtual parts and gamification features
                  were integrated into the virtual assembly environment. An
                  experiment was conducted in two conditions: a gamified and a
                  non-gamified virtual environment. Subjects had to assemble a
                  virtual pump. The user performance was evaluated in terms of
                  the number of errors, the feasibility of the generated
                  assembly sequence and the user feedback.Findings The
                  gamification reduced the number of errors and increased the
                  score representing the number of right decisions. The results
                  of the subjective and objective analysis showed that the
                  number of errors decreased with engagement in the gamified
                  assembly. The increase in the overall user experience reduced
                  the number of errors. The subjective evaluation showed a
                  significant difference between the gamified and the
                  non-gamified assembly in terms of the level of engagement, the
                  learning usability and the overall experience.Research
                  limitations/implications The effective learning retention
                  after training has not been tested, and longitudinal studies
                  are necessary. The effect of the used gamification elements
                  has been evaluated as a whole; further work could isolate the
                  most beneficial features and add other elements that might be
                  more beneficial for learning.Originality/value The research
                  reported in this paper provides valuable insights into the
                  gamification of virtual assembly using a low-cost multi-touch
                  interface. The results are promising for training operators to
                  assemble a product at the design stage.},

               led to the rapid adoption, sharing of 3D models on sites such as
               Thingiverse.com, and visions of a future in which customization
               is a norm and 3D printing can solve a variety of real-world
               problems. However, in practice, creating models is difficult and
               many end users simply print models created by others. In this
               paper, we explore a specific area of model design that is a
               challenge for end users' measurement. When a model must conform
               to a specific real world goal once printed, it is important that
               that goal is precisely specified. We demonstrate that measurement
               errors are a significant (yet often overlooked) challenge for end
               users through a systematic study of the sources and types of
               measurement errors. We argue for a new design
               principle--accommodating measurement error--that designers, as
               well as novice modelers, should to use at design time. We offer
               two strategies--buffer insertion and replacement of minimal
               parts--to help designers, as well as novice modelers, to build
               models that are robust to measurement error. We argue that these
               strategies can reduce the need for and costs of iteration and

               can be physically opened, closed, pushed, pulled, spun, flipped,
               or swung. But these tangible, interactive reading experiences are
               inaccessible to children with visual impairments. This paper
               presents a set of 3D-printable models designed as building blocks
               for creating movable tactile pictures that can be touched, moved,
               and understood by children with visual impairments. Examples of
               these models are canvases, connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders,
               lifts, walls, and cutouts. They can be used to compose movable
               tactile pictures to convey a range of spatial concepts, such as
               in/out, up/down, and high/low. The design and development of
               these models were informed by three formative studies including
               1) a survey on popular moving mechanisms in children's books and
               3D-printed parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the
               process creating movable tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego,
               Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based prototypes and an
               informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a
               design language based on XML and CSS for specifying the content
               and structure of a movable tactile picture. Given a
               specification, our system can generate a 3D-printable model. We
               evaluate our approach by 1) transcribing six children's books,
               and 2) conducting six interviews on domain experts including four
               teachers for the visually impaired, one blind adult, two
               publishers at the National Braille Press, a renowned tactile

                  with its use and understandings being context dependent. As an
                  essential element within and of education, literacy offers
                  possibilities for engaging in everyday life. Health literacy
                  has emerged as a means to develop health-promoting practices
                  that has meaning in social contexts. Reflecting biomedical
                  interests, the focus of health literacy is predominately
                  constructed as a neutral and technical process that has
                  specific meaning and practice, positioning it as functional
                  literacy. This paper presents one approach to critical health
                  literacy based on a multidimension (3D) approach with literacy
                  as a situated social practice. The 3D model will be described
                  and then the model’s application to health literacy will be
                  explored. The use of the 3D model to build critical health
                  literacy challenges the biomedical approach to health literacy
                  as solely functional literacy. Functional literacy is not
                  sufficient for a person to build a critical social
                  consciousness and illuminate how social determinates of health
                  create inequitable health or how it could be ameliorated.
                  Social justice and equity are presented as fundamental
                  prerequisites for health. Working with young people in context
                  of schools, the reciprocal relationship between health and
                  education offers space for possibilities around literacy
                  skills and understanding about what creates health. The same
                  space can enable young people to see opportunities for
                  empowerment to shape and recreate their social reality. Health
                  literacy for social justice and equity, therefore, has to
                  include possibilities for understanding and responding to
                  sociocultural knowing.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology
                  employed in many research studies. Qualitative and
                  quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a
                  grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or
                  construct theory from data, systematically obtained and
                  analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is
                  inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice
                  researchers strive to understand the discourse and the
                  practical application of grounded theory concepts and
                  processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a
                  contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded
                  theory study. RESULT: This article provides an overview of
                  grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation
                  of the processes and methods employed in conducting research
                  using this methodology. The framework is presented as a
                  diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a
                  visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher.
                  DISCUSSION: As grounded theory is not a linear process, the
                  framework illustrates the interplay between the essential
                  grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions
                  involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that
                  underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
                  CONCLUSION: Rather than an engagement in philosophical
                  discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be
                  used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a
                  framework for a research study design can be used to guide and
                  inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using
                  grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can
                  contribute to policy or knowledge development, service
                  provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the
                  substantive area of inquiry.},

                  article reporting standards as they applied to qualitative
                  research and with generating recommendations for standards
                  that would be appropriate for a wide range of methods within
                  the discipline of psychology. These standards describe what
                  should be included in a research report to enable and
                  facilitate the review process. This publication marks a
                  historical moment-the first inclusion of qualitative research
                  in APA Style, which is the basis of both the Publication
                  Manual of the American Psychological Association (APA, 2010)
                  and APA Style CENTRAL, an online program to support APA Style.
                  In addition to the general JARS-Qual guidelines, the Working
                  Group has developed standards for both qualitative
                  meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The reporting
                  standards were developed for psychological qualitative
                  research but may hold utility for a broad range of social
                  sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions,
                  methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed
                  of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods,
                  research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article,
                  they present these standards and their rationale, and they
                  detail the ways that the standards differ from the

                  the standards can be used by authors in the process of writing

                  and editors in the process of reviewing research. (PsycINFO

                  Emissions of the greenhouse gases that cause climate change
                  reached a new peak in 2022, according to early estimates. And
                  climate disasters seem to be hitting at a breakneck pace. In
                  2022, the world experienced record heat waves in China and
                  Europe, and devastating floods in Pakistan killed over 1,000
                  people and displaced millions. But a close look at energy and
                  emissions data around the world shows that there are a few
                  bright spots of good news, and a lot of potential progress
                  ahead. For example, renewable sources make up a growing
                  fraction of the energy supply, and they're getting cheaper
                  every year. Countries are setting new targets for emissions
                  reductions, and unprecedented public investments could unlock
                  more technological advances. Here, few reasons to be hopeful
                  are highlighted. It includes the less dependent of economic
                  growth of fossil fuels, and the need for climate progress to

  abstract     = {Though there was indeed a key shift in the meaning of "design"
                  between 1300 and 1500, it had less to do with language and
                  more with a fundamental shift in the making of things
                  themselves. The relationship between drawing and design did
                  not give rise to a word--or even expand its meaning. Rather,
                  it diminished the word as it had previously been used, and in
                  a way that may now be important to reverse. The Latin root of
                  "design," designo, conveyed to the likes of Cicero a far
                  wider, more abstract set of meanings than many generally give
                  the word today. These ranged from the literal and material
                  (like tracing) through the tactical (to contrive and achieve a
                  goal) to the organizational and institutional--as in the
                  strategic "designation" of people and objects (where the root
                  "design" remains visibly embedded). All these meanings share a
                  broad sense of imposing shape on the world, in its
                  institutions and arrangements.},

                  IDEO's way of working: a six-step methodology for innovation
                  called design thinking, which had emerged in the 1990s but had
                  started reaching the height of its popularity in the tech,
                  business, and social-impact sectors. Key to design thinking's
                  spread was its replicable aesthetic, represented by the

  abstract  = {This is a strong foundation of human-centric virtual reality
               design for anyone and everyone involved in creating VR
               experiences. Without a clear understanding of the human side of
               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and
               pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration
               and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR
               execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of
               understanding human perception, interaction, design principles,
               and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR,
               such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various
               forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and
               pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR
               applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for
               managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers,
               students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for
               the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at
               least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry
               is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of
               building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable
               processes to efficiently iterate towards success. It contains
               extensive details on the most important aspects of VR, more than
               600 applicable guidelines, and over 300 additional references.},

                  into using 360° videos to present small segments of lecture
                  content for IT students in an Australian University. The aim
                  of this study was to understand; what is the impact of
                  incorporating 360° videos into class content for students and
                  teaching staff? In this study the 360° videos are described as
                  “learning atoms”. Learning atoms are short duration videos (1
                  to 5 minutes) captured in 360°. Background: Within this paper
                  we conducted experiments in the classroom using 360° videos to
                  determine if they have an impact on student's feeling of
                  presence with class content. Additionally, to follow up, how
                  does the inclusion of 360° impact on the teaching experience.
                  Methodology: The methodology used in this study focused on
                  both quantitative and qualita-tive aspects. Data was captured
                  at the same time during the teaching period to address the
                  research questions. In order to gauge the feeling of presence
                  within the classroom a short survey was administered to
                  students in the undergraduate IT class at the start (pre) and
                  end (post) of the semester using the same questions to measure
                  any change. Contribution: The main contributions from this
                  study were that we demonstrated there is a potential for
                  providing an alternative ‘immersive’ content presentation for
                  students. This alternative content took the form of 360°
                  learning atoms, whereas further showed our nuance process for
                  creating and publishing of these atoms. Findings: The results
                  show that for students, learning atoms can help improve the
                  sense of presence, particularly for remote students, however
                  the interactive experience can take student’s attention away
                  from the lecturer. The results present potential for providing
                  an alternative ‘immersive’ content presentation for students,
                  however problems for uptake are present for both students and
                  teachers, such as image capture quality and file size Impact
                  on Society: We foresee this approach as being a new approach
                  to teaching students in higher education within online spaces
                  to increase engagement and move towards having a richer
                  virtual experience no matter the location. Future Research:
                  Future research will be conducted to resolve whether presence
                  and engagement is supported by the inclusion of 360° videos in
                  the classroom.},

                a table in which the nature of the underlying scene, how it is
                viewed, and the observer's reference to it are compared, and

                comprising: extent of world knowledge, reproduction fidelity,
                and extent of presence metaphor. A principal objective of the
                taxonomy is to clarify terminology issues and to provide a

  abstract     = {Pokémon Go was the first mobile augmented reality (AR) game to
                  reach the top of the download charts of mobile applications.
                  However, little is known about this new generation of mobile
                  online AR games. Existing theories provide limited
                  applicability for user understanding. Against this background,
                  this research provides a comprehensive framework based on uses
                  and gratification theory, technology risk research, and flow
                  theory. The proposed framework aims to explain the drivers of
                  attitudinal and intentional reactions, such as continuance in
                  gaming or willingness to invest money in in-app purchases. A
                  survey among 642 Pokémon Go players provides insights into the
                  psychological drivers of mobile AR games. The results show
                  that hedonic, emotional, and social benefits and social norms
                  drive consumer reactions while physical risks (but not data
                  privacy risks) hinder consumer reactions. However, the
                  importance of these drivers differs depending on the form of
                  user behavior.},

  abstract     = {In a construction project, cranes are usually involved in the
                  mobilization of materials and equipment. Therefore, a
                  well-planned crane movement on a construction job site
                  increases the efficiency of construction operations. This is
                  especially the case when a crane is being operated from the
                  material storage place to the workspace in a highway
                  construction project, because the time allowed for such
                  movement is typically tight, as constrained by the vehicular
                  traffic on the highway. To explore the use of construction
                  simulation in facilitating people?s understanding of
                  construction processes, this paper presents a crane movement
                  simulation from the site storage location to the beam erection
                  location in a highway construction project on the Interstate
                  94. This simulation was modeled in the Unity 3D game engine
                  and visualized in a CAVE virtual reality environment. CAVE is
                  an immersive virtual reality environment where projections
                  according to different view angles of a scene are projected
                  onto different walls of a space. The purpose of this
                  simulation is to help people plan crane routes during the
                  construction planning phase. The objectives of planning the
                  crane routes are minimizing crane trip length and trip time so
                  as to minimize interruptions to the highway traffic, save
                  construction costs, and achieve more sustainable construction
                  operations. The simulation was tried by 72 volunteers. A
                  survey of these volunteers showed that 95\% of them understood
                  crane operations after trying the simulation, compared to 35\%
                  before trying the simulation, and 80\% of the responses agreed
                  that such simulation helps people conduct construction
                  planning.},

  abstract     = {Purpose Apprenticeship programmes are designed to provide
                  young trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
                  apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
                  fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
                  useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
                  workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However,
                  the completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in
                  the construction sector remain low in several countries across
                  the globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
                  published research on apprenticeship training that is
                  specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
                  the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
                  research.Design/methodology/approach A systematic review
                  approach was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using
                  SCOPUS databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified
                  and analysed.Findings It was found that monitoring and control
                  is the most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in
                  the completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast,
                  the length of time required for going through the full
                  training is the most common factor responsible for low
                  completion rates. Three research gaps were identified, among
                  which is the dearth of studies that has focused on apprentices
                  training in developing countries.Research
                  limitations/implications The gaps identified in the current
                  knowledge on apprenticeship training would serve as a
                  justification for future investigations. However, the scope of
                  the review is limited to papers published in academic journals
                  and citable through SCOPUS.Practical implications The outcomes
                  of the study provide researchers and other relevant
                  stakeholders with a concise report on the findings of previous
                  studies. It also provides insight into strategies for
                  improving the completion rates of apprenticeship training in
                  the construction sector.Originality/value A systematic
                  evaluation of the extant literature draws on theoretical
                  evidence and highlights the factors that are more likely to
                  influence the outcomes of apprentice training for craftspeople
                  in the construction sector.},

                  to predict returns to custody by 2015?2016. Overall, the
                  results showed that participating in vocational education and

                  have various backgrounds in terms of knowledge, but the

  abstract  = {It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
               of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
               most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
               required for expert practice in fields from painting and
               sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
               while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
               differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
               are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
               a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
               and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
               uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
               target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
               practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
               meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
               learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
               context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
               serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
               students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
               implications through a proposal for the retooling of
               apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
               skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
               cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
               problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
               reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
               is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
               believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
               pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
               features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
               what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
               we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
               "success models," which we believe exemplify aspects of
               apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
               skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
               to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
               the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
               metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
               section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
               characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
               for the design of learning environments, where "environment"
               includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
               employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
               sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
               apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
               apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
               designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
               materials, and technologies.},

                  Schön's theory. The results supported the basic assumption of
                  Schön's theory that reflecting practitioners use a
                  constructivist decision-making perspective while
                  non-reflecting educators use an instrumental problem-solving
                  approach. The findings demonstrated that reflecting educators,
                  whether novice or experienced, use reflecting-in-action and
                  reflecting-on-action as a means to develop expertise. The

  date      = {2013},
  abstract  = {This article seeks to propose a rationale for exploratory
               research in the social sciences. Inspired by the recent debates
               around qualitative methods (Gerring, 2001; George and Bennett,
               2005; Brady and Collier, 2004; Mahoney and Rueschemeyer, 2003;
               Ragin, 2008; to name just a few), I seek to demonstrate that
               exploratory research also has a rightful place within the social
               sciences. In order to live up to its potential, exploratory
               research needs to be conducted in a transparent, honest, and
               selfreflexive way – and follow a set of guidelines that ensure
               its reliability. Exploratory research, if conducted in such a
               way, can achieve great validity and it can provide new and
               innovative ways to analyze reality. In most cases, exploration
               demands more from the researcher than confirmatory research, both
               in terms of preparation, as well as in terms of willingness and
               ability to expose oneself to foreign cultures and languages as
               well as the courage to engage in a critical and honest
               selfreflection and critique. It also requires intellectual
               engagement with the topic at stake far beyond the needs of those
               running regressions from their office computers. However,
               exploratory research normally demands less money to conduct, as
               most projects can be done by one researcher alone, without the
               need to mobilize, train, and pay, large research apparatuses.
               Given the disciplinary power of elite scholars and academic
               institutions when it comes to selecting research through funding
               and hiring, exploratory research thus has great emancipatory
               potential, because it can escape the disciplinary power of senior
               “peers” and mainstream funding agencies. To legitimize and
               provide a solid epistemological ground for exploratory research
               in the social sciences, it needs to be grounded in a philosophy
               of science; it has to be articulated within an epistemological
               framework; and it has to formulate a comprehensive methodological
               framework that justifies its methods. Thought also needs to be
               given to the ontology of the social sciences, as decisions about
               what counts as real and what we shall accept as a fact
               necessarily impact our strategy of inquiry.},

                  construction industry as a test case to explore the
                  applicability of HRO and RE in a less highly regulated
                  context. Through this discussion the research gaps are
                  highlighted which have prevented the expansion of these new
                  approaches into new sectors. The project-based nature,
                  transient workforce, widespread outsourcing of labour and
                  financial pressure of the construction sector limit
                  opportunities for investment in employees and learning from
                  experience; hence, developing principles advocated by HRO and
                  RE such as management commitment, sensitivity to the
                  frontline, prioritisation of safety, empowerment of employees,
                  and a just culture presents a significant challenge. In spite
                  of these barriers, there are also opportunities to be
                  considered for construction to incorporate aspects of HRO and
                  RE at an employee-centred level rather than organisational:
                  Aspects of mindfulness and imagination; RE’s progressive
                  understanding of accidents; and its holistic approach to
                  cultivating resilience. It is argued that these opportunities
                  offer a useful perspective for reframing safety debates in
                  construction. The paper concludes with a research agenda which
                  puts forward the need to extend and adapt aspects of HRO and
                  RE in order to tackle some of the key characteristics of
                  construction, namely subcontractor networks and temporary
                  projects.},

  abstract     = {Maps are a mainstay of visual, somatosensory, and motor coding
                  in many species. However, auditory maps of space have not been
                  reported in the primate brain. Instead, recent studies have
                  suggested that sound location may be encoded via broadly
                  responsive neurons whose firing rates vary roughly
                  proportionately with sound azimuth. Within frontal space, maps
                  and such rate codes involve different response patterns at the
                  level of individual neurons. Maps consist of neurons
                  exhibiting circumscribed receptive fields, whereas rate codes
                  involve open-ended response patterns that peak in the
                  periphery. This coding format discrepancy therefore poses a
                  potential problem for brain regions responsible for
                  representing both visual and auditory information. Here, we
                  investigated the coding of auditory space in the primate
                  superior colliculus(SC), a structure known to contain visual
                  and oculomotor maps for guiding saccades. We report that, for
                  visual stimuli, neurons showed circumscribed receptive fields
                  consistent with a map, but for auditory stimuli, they had
                  open-ended response patterns consistent with a rate or
                  level-of-activity code for location. The discrepant response
                  patterns were not segregated into different neural populations
                  but occurred in the same neurons. We show that a read-out
                  algorithm in which the site and level of SC activity both
                  contribute to the computation of stimulus location is
                  successful at evaluating the discrepant visual and auditory
                  codes, and can account for subtle but systematic differences
                  in the accuracy of auditory compared to visual saccades. This
                  suggests that a given population of neurons can use different
                  codes to support appropriate multimodal behavior.},

               acceptance of Augmented Reality and Wearable Technologies and we

               being intuitive and easy to learn to use. The respondents

  abstract     = {Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant
                  physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual
                  interpretations ("percepts") that alternate over time.
                  Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive,
                  suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies
                  changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to
                  address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we
                  introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil
                  dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a
                  continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a
                  gradual subjective report. We find that the "reflexes" reflect
                  the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both reflexes
                  show a gradual dependence on the time relative to perceptual
                  transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick deflections, which
                  are highly correlated with the reflex measures, indicate
                  gradual transitions. Physically simulating wave-like
                  transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal rivalry (i.e.,
                  different regions of space belonging to distinct percepts) as
                  one possible explanation for the gradual transitions.
                  Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance durations depend
                  on whether or not the percept is actively reported. In
                  addition, reflexes respond to transitions with shorter
                  latencies than the subjective report and show an abundance of
                  short dominance durations. This failure to report fast changes
                  in dominance may result from limited access of introspection
                  to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal that rivalry is a
                  gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is modulated by the
                  required action (response mode), and that rapid transitions in
                  perceptual dominance can slip away from awareness.},

                  medicine and the empirical evidence available. This theory
                  describes expertise development as the progression through a
                  series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized
                  by functionally different knowledge structures underlying
                  performance. The first phase is characterized by the
                  accumulation of causal knowledge about disease and its
                  consequences. Through experience with real cases, this
                  knowledge transforms into narrative structures called illness
                  scripts. The cognitive mechanisms responsible for this
                  transition are: Encapsulation of elaborated knowledge into
                  high level but simplified causal models or even diagnostic
                  categories and tuning through the inclusion of contextual
                  information. The third phase is characterized by the use of
                  episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of new
                  cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
                  phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
                  These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any
                  more in subsequent phases in the development of expertise,
                  remain available for use when ontologically more recently
                  acquired structures fail to produce an adequate representation

                  social research. It outlines what is taken to be the
                  conventional view in many methodological discussions, namely,
                  that research questions guide decisions about research design
                  and research methods. This position is taken to imply that
                  social researchers typically take the view that research
                  methods need to be tailored to the research questions that
                  guide an investigation. The paper questions how far this
                  position pertains to actual research practice. Drawing on
                  interviews with researchers about their practices in relation
                  to mixed?method research, two discourses were found in the
                  transcripts. A particularistic discourse that reflects the
                  traditional view, whereby mixed?method research is viewed as
                  only appropriate when research questions warrant it, was

  abstract     = {Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy,
                  perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics,
                  cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During
                  the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in
                  these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive
                  ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology.
                  In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown
                  rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social
                  neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and
                  developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition
                  appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout
                  cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to
                  increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder
                  whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive
                  system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms.
                  Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by
                  demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed
                  theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory
                  driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is
                  the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into
                  cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive
                  phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of
                  these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along
                  with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded
                  cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both
                  cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by
                  developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three
                  major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic
                  architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded
                  cognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future
                  theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of
                  intelligence.},

                  tests. The approaches range from global analysis, attention to
                  object parts, holistic and piecemeal strategy to a combined
                  strategy. Other studies do not speak of strategies, but of
                  holistic or piecemeal processes or even of holistic or
                  piecemeal rotation. The methodological approach used here is
                  to identify mental-rotation strategies via gaze patterns
                  derived from eye-tracking data when solving chronometric
                  mental-rotation tasks with gender-stereotyped objects. The
                  mental-rotation test consists of 3 male-stereotyped objects
                  (locomotive, hammer, wrench) and 3 femalestereotyped objects
                  (pram, hand mirror, brush) rotated at eight different angles.
                  The sample consisted of 16 women and 10 men (age: M=21.58;
                  SD=4.21). The results of a qualitative analysis with two
                  individual objects (wrench and brush) showed four different
                  gaze patterns. These gaze patterns appeared with different
                  frequency in the two objects and correlated differently with
                  performance and response time. The results indicate either an
                  objectoriented or an egocentric mental-rotation strategy
                  behind the gaze patterns. In general, a new methodological
                  approach has been developed to identify mental-rotation
                  strategies bottom-up which can also be used for other stimulus

               by mapping situations to actions so as to maximize cumulative
               rewards. In recent years RL has achieved great success in
               inducing effective pedagogical policies for various interactive
               e-learning environments. However, it is often prohibitive to
               identify the critical pedagogical decisions that actually
               contribute to desirable learning outcomes. In this work, by
               utilizing the RL framework we defined critical decisions to be
               those states in which the agent has to take the optimal actions,
               and subsequently, the Critical policy as carrying out optimal
               actions in the critical states while acting randomly in others.
               We proposed a general Critical-RL framework for identifying
               critical decisions and inducing a Critical policy. The
               effectiveness of our Critical-RL framework is empirically
               evaluated from two perspectives: whether optimal actions must be
               carried out in critical states (the necessary hypothesis) and
               whether only carrying out optimal actions in critical states is
               as effective as a fully-executed RL policy (the sufficient
               hypothesis). Our results confirmed both hypotheses.},

  abstract     = {This paper is to investigate how employees’ tacit knowledge
                  sharing behavior is influenced by various antecedents. We
                  propose that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three
                  specific behaviors (i.e., socialization, externalization, and
                  internalization) and they are influenced by four antecedents
                  (trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A
                  survey was conducted to collect data from 258 knowledge
                  workers who worked on complex product development projects.
                  Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The
                  results demonstrate that trust, self-efficacy, knowledge
                  tacitness, and IT support significantly affect the
                  externalization and internalization behaviors, and trust and
                  IT support significantly affect the socialization behavior.
                  This study is helpful to organizations where it is critical
                  for employees to share tacit knowledge. It suggests that tacit
                  knowledge is difficult to share and organizations should
                  nurture mutual trust between employees, enhance their
                  self-efficacy, and provide sufficient IT support so that they
                  are more likely to engage in tacit knowledge sharing.},

                  the source of many injuries and fatalities that end up costing
                  the industry a lot of money. In order to reduce the injuries
                  that occur on an annual basis, better training techniques are
                  examined. Virtual reality is examined as a way to enhance
                  current training practices that consist mainly of slide show
                  presentations and videos. Virtual reality is examined for
                  task-based training where the user can interact with a working
                  environment safely. The user is given tasks to complete within
                  the virtual environment similar to tasks a worker would have
                  to complete on a day to day basis. The purpose of the program
                  is to be a method of rapidly training younger miners while
                  supplementing on-the-job training practices and ultimately
                  reduce accidents. The model was developed using CAD software
                  and then imported into Deep Creator's Right Hemisphere where
                  animations were added and functions were programmed to
                  objects. The user's performance is tracked through the use of
                  LISP programming and scores are tallied to judge user
                  performance. The application was tested for quality of
                  information, usability, and learning potential over other
                  training methods.},

                  Emerging head-worn AR technologies can display rich graphical
                  imagery of large-scale environments and permit intuitive
                  interaction through gestural and voice inputs. Yet, how users

                  interaction strategies yield the best spatial memory and
                  navigation performance remain open questions. In the present
                  empirical investigation, we related user interactions in a 3D
                  geo-visualization application implemented on the Microsoft
                  HoloLens AR system to virtual navigation outcomes. Informed by
                  spatial cognitive theory, we uncovered interaction strategies
                  during goal-oriented study of a 3D urban environment that
                  predicted different aspects of navigation performance. Users
                  who positioned the 3D city model to gain an overhead (i.e.
                  survey perspective) view early on performed best when later
                  following the route from memory. In contrast, consistent
                  interaction switching (i.e. perspective transformation) during
                  study predicted navigational efficiency when participants were
                  unexpectedly tasked to return to the origin of the route.
                  Individual differences also related to aspects of user
                  interaction. Implications for 3D geo-visualization and

               knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between
               tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature
               tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions,
               whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or the
               process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first principles
               shows that knowledge has different degrees of validity, is highly
               heterogeneous and has complicated temporal and social aspects. A
               model of knowledge based on these aspects is presented. Comparing
               the four dimensions of knowledge with knowledge as a process
               opens up a more holistic view of knowledge management and helps
               articulate some of the key differences within streams of research
               in the field. This holistic perspective is also compatible with
               Polanyi's original complex conception of tacit knowledge, which
               drew heavily on Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the
               perception of "wholes". The dual perspectives of a
               multi-dimensional conception of knowledge as a commodity and a
               holistic perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues
               of potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge

               than we can tell." Many researchers in the knowledge management
               community have used the idea of tacit knowledge to draw a
               distinction between that which cannot be formally represented
               (tacit knowledge) and knowledge which can be so represented
               (explicit knowledge). I argue that the deference that knowledge
               management researchers give to tacit knowledge hinders
               potentially fruitful work for two important reasons. First, the
               inability to explicate knowledge does not imply that the
               knowledge cannot be formally represented. Second, assuming the
               inability to formalize tacit knowledge as it exists in the minds
               of people does not exclude the possibility that computer systems
               might perform the same tasks using alternative representations.
               By reviewing work from artificial intelligence, I will argue that
               a richer model of cognition and knowledge representation is

                  viewpoint that virtual reality software could be a new focus
                  of direction in the development of training tools in medical
                  education. We carried out a panel discussion at the Center for
                  Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference, prompted by the study,
                  "The Responses of Medical General Practitioners to
                  Unreasonable Patient Demand for Antibiotics--A Study of
                  Medical Ethics Using Immersive Virtual Reality" (1). METHODS:
                  In Pan et al.'s study, 21 general practitioners (GPs) and GP
                  trainees took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality
                  scenario involving unnecessary patient demands for
                  antibiotics. This paper was discussed in-depth at the Center
                  for Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference; the content of this
                  paper is a culmination of findings and feedback from the panel
                  discussion. The experts involved have backgrounds in virtual
                  reality, general practice, medicines management, medical
                  education and training, ethics, and philosophy. VIEWPOINT:
                  Virtual reality is an unexplored methodology to instigate
                  positive behavioral change among clinicians where other
                  methods have been unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial
                  stewardship. There are several arguments in favor of use of
                  virtual reality in medical education: it can be used for
                  "difficult to simulate" scenarios and to standardize a
                  scenario, for example, for use in exams. However, there are
                  limitations to its usefulness because of the cost implications
                  and the lack of evidence that it results in demonstrable
                  behavior change.},

               and motor skills. The future of work will increasingly feature
               human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks
               and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning
               in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants,
               where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they
               are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we
               explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that
               help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by
               providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized
               experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse
               than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and
               learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but
               was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at
               all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even
               when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel
               learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy,
               with the goal of obtaining additional training labels that can be
               used for fine-tuning the machine. A simulation study illustrates
               how even noisy labels can increase the machine’s accuracy.},

                  emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                  extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                  variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                  volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                  comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                  become one of the most important areas of research within
                  educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                  analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne
                  and Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and
                  Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the
                  following aspects: (a) history and development, (b)
                  description of the model (including the model figures), (c)
                  empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on
                  the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of
                  aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how
                  they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion,
                  (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In
                  the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                  meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                  extracted. Further, four future lines of research are
                  proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the
                  SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from
                  which to conduct research and on which students can be taught
                  to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the
                  available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential
                  effects of SRL models in light of differences in students'
                  developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and
                  teachers need to start applying these differential effects of
                  the SRL models and theories to enhance students' learning and
                  SRL skills.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Background Internships are highly relevant learning
                  experiences for engineering students. However, such
                  practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                  allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring
                  the job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed
                  to investigate how job demands, job control, and social
                  support affect interns' use of different learning strategies.
                  Method The study utilized data collected from a sample of
                  engineering students (n =?118) who completed a required
                  internship during their degree. The data were analyzed using a
                  structural equation modeling approach including latent
                  factors. Results Job demands were found to be a relevant and
                  significant driver of students' shared regulation (e.g.,
                  asking for feedback), self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use
                  of codified information), efforts to relate theory to practice
                  (e.g., connecting workplace experience with theoretical
                  knowledge), and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g.,
                  lack of adaptation to work situations), but not of external
                  regulation (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job
                  control, however, was not found to be a positive or
                  significant driver of student learning. Social support was
                  found to be a relevant and significant predictor of external
                  and shared regulation but not of the other learning
                  activities. Conclusions This study provided mixed findings
                  regarding key hypotheses central to the JDCS model, generating
                  rather poor evidence supporting it. In fact, job demands, job
                  control, and social support exhibited much less explanatory
                  power than expected for engineering students' learning during
                  internships.},

                  conventional teacher–student classroom settings, but there are

                  whether certain aspects of the way in which images are
                  transformed should be attributed to intrinsic
                  knowledge-independent properties of the medium in which images
                  are instantiated or the mechanisms by which they are
                  processed; or (b) whether images are typically transformed in
                  certain ways because Ss take their task to be the simulation
                  of the act of witnessing certain real events taking place and
                  therefore use their tacit knowledge of the imaged situation to
                  cause the transformation to proceed as they believe it would
                  have proceeded in reality. The tacit knowledge account is seen
                  as more plausible because empirical results demonstrate that
                  both "mental scanning" and "mental rotation" transformations
                  can be critically influenced by varying the instructions given
                  to Ss and the precise form of the task used and, that the form
                  of the influence is explainable in terms of the semantic
                  content of Ss' beliefs and goals. (40 ref) (PsycINFO Database

  abstract     = {Although the study of visual perception has made more progress
                  in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science,
                  there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is
                  tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the
                  arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision,
                  neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other
                  areas of vision science) and defends the position that an
                  important part of visual perception, corresponding to what
                  some people have called early vision, is prohibited from
                  accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in
                  determining the function it computes--in other words, it is
                  cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and
                  involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early
                  vision system. Its function is to provide a structured
                  representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to
                  serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs
                  being made available to other systems such as those dealing
                  with motor control. The paper also addresses certain
                  conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim,
                  such as whether signal detection theory and event-related
                  potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of
                  vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual
                  processing, including, in addition to the inflexible
                  early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation
                  stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and
                  inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two
                  stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect
                  the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses
                  arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that
                  vision is "intelligent" and involves elements of "problem
                  solving." The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation
                  sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive
                  penetration; rather, they show that certain natural
                  constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with
                  optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been
                  compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a
                  number of examples where instructions and "hints" are alleged
                  to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded that the
                  evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that when
                  cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside early
                  vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal attention
                  and the identification of the stimulus.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as
                  simulation technology in emergency medicine education and
                  training, in particular for training nontechnical skills.
                  Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR
                  with traditional training media often demonstrate the
                  equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables
                  of learning or training effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: In the
                  EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious
                  Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive
                  room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment
                  was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain
                  initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use
                  factors influencing learning and training in VR. METHODS: The
                  virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with
                  shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as
                  well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient)
                  visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather
                  (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and
                  posttest design was used to evaluate the training
                  effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The
                  sample included 18 active emergency physicians. RESULTS: The
                  18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in
                  terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training
                  execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01)
                  between experiencing presence and assessing training
                  effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability
                  and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this
                  positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The training within the virtual
                  simulation environment was rated as an effective educational
                  approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate
                  training effectiveness (ie, improvement through "experience of
                  presence" or reduction through perceived limitations in
                  usability). These factors should be specific targets in the
                  further development of this VR simulation training.},

                  environments are a major concern within the construction
                  industry. While traditional education and training of
                  personnel offer well-known approaches for establishing safe
                  work practices, serious games in virtual reality (VR) are used
                  more often as a complementary approach for active,
                  personalized learning experiences. Their designs yet have to
                  take full advantage of how trainees can potentially manipulate
                  and interact with virtual objects. In addition, little
                  construction safety research has focused on generating and
                  analyzing the inherent data that can be collected about the
                  trainees’ actions in the virtual environment. The objective
                  analysis of their performance in the virtual environment
                  offers precise feedback to sensitize their work behavior later
                  in real practice. This research presents a novel framework for
                  the generation and assessment of the trainees’ data in
                  augmented virtuality (AV). The proposed approach is tested in
                  a virtual work environment consisting of multiple stages and
                  hazards that are consistent within today’s construction sites
                  and workshops. A real angle grinder has been reworked and
                  repurposed as an interactive AV controller to further enhance
                  immersion. Results on the performance in the proposed system
                  and the experiences of two groups of volunteering participants
                  are presented and discussed. An outlook presents future
                  avenues towards enhancing existing construction safety
                  education and focus points on correlating objective tracking

                  studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency
                  of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of

                  incorporated educational theory in the design and
                  implementation of the training. The results reveal that, of
                  the 15 construction training studies that met the inclusion
                  criteria, two-thirds (2/3) focused on worker safety and only
                  three studies (20\%) targeted managers or designers. Fewer
                  than 35\% of terms that were identified as frequently used
                  terms in the published construction training studies were
                  categorized as educational. The results of this study provide
                  a baseline of education theory–integrated construction

                SWOT-analysis, with data gathered from a literature study. Main
                keywords in the literature search were: artificial intelligence,
                artificial intelligence in education, AIED, teacher perspective,
                education and teacher. Themes and patterns in the four main
                categories where further processed as a deductive-inductive
                thematic analysis. Findings indicates that there are both
                promises and threats for the teacher in the contemporary AIED.
                In several aspects the field seems to be in a state of hype but
                as other hype areas there is a potential for maturing and with
                concrete applications in daily teaching and learning activities.
                Recommendations is to learn from traditional AI and to open up
                for an informative and nuanced discussion concerning the role of
                AI in education. Otherwise there is a risk for artificial
                education instead of artificial intelligence in education.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The aim was to investigate if individual
                  self-practice of the ABCDE approach (Airways, Breathing,
                  Circulation, Disability, Exposure) in an immersive and
                  interactive virtual reality (VR) application gave non-inferior
                  learning outcome compared to using traditional equipment (TP)
                  in first year medical and nursing students. METHODS: A
                  non-inferior parallel group randomized controlled trial. The
                  study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in
                  August and September 2019. All students participated in a
                  15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced
                  the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and
                  interactive VR application using hand controllers with some
                  haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge,
                  ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary
                  outcome was the number of students who documented all the
                  eight predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the
                  correct order in a practical test on an advanced simulator
                  manikin with a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the
                  self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit
                  was 13\% points. RESULTS: Of all eligible students, 84\%
                  participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n =
                  149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed
                  non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8\% in
                  individual VR doing all observations in correct order compared
                  to 27.1\% TP (absolute difference 2.3\% points, one sided 95\%
                  CI 2.3 to 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between
                  the groups, but more students in VR reported liking the way
                  they practiced (absolute difference 46\% points, 95\% CI 36.5
                  to 56.6) and that it was a good way to learn (36.9\% points,
                  95\% CI 26.8 to 47). VR also scored high on the System
                  Usability Scale (mean difference 6.4\% points, 95\% CI
                  2.8-10.1). CONCLUSIONS: Individual self-practicing the ABCDE
                  approach in VR was non-inferior to individual self-practicing
                  with traditional equipment.},

               through several approaches to coding, analysis, and reporting.
               Packed with definitions and illustrative examples, this highly
               accessible book concludes with chapters that present criteria for
               evaluating a study, as well as responses to common questions
               posed by students of qualitative research. New end-of-chapter
               “Insider Insights” contributed by qualitative researchers give
               readers a sense of what it’s like to work in the field.

                  as well as the impact of selected instructional design
                  principles in the context of virtual reality technology-based
                  instruction (i.e. games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12
                  or higher education settings. A total of 13 studies (N = 3081)
                  in the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the
                  category of games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category
                  of virtual worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion
                  criteria were that the study came from K-12 or higher
                  education settings, used experimental or quasi-experimental
                  research designs, and used a learning outcome measure to
                  evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based
                  instruction.Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51),
                  simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM
                  = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning
                  outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes
                  was statistically significant, indicating that the studies
                  were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted
                  moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the
                  studies. Key findings included that: games show higher
                  learning gains than simulations and virtual worlds. For
                  simulation studies, elaborate explanation type feedback is
                  more suitable for declarative tasks whereas knowledge of
                  correct response is more appropriate for procedural tasks.
                  Students performance is enhanced when they conduct the game
                  play individually than in a group. In addition, we found an
                  inverse relationship between number of treatment sessions
                  learning gains for games.With regards to the virtual world, we
                  found that if students were repeatedly measured it
                  deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results
                  to highlight the importance of considering instructional
                  design principles when designing virtual reality-based
                  instruction.},

                  methodology: focusing attention on what occurs as
                  interlocutors move among settings and situations. Whereas
                  ethnographers often zoom in on one principal set of situations
                  or site, we argue that intersituational variation broadens and
                  deepens the researcher?s ethnographic account as well as
                  affording important correctives to some common inferential
                  pitfalls. We provide four warrants for shadowing: (a)
                  buttressing intersituational claims, (b) deepening
                  ethnographers? ability to trace meaning making by showing how
                  meanings shift as they travel and how such shifts may affect
                  interlocutors? understandings, (c) gaining leverage on the
                  structure of subjects? social worlds, and (d) helping the
                  ethnographer make larger causal arguments. We show the use
                  value of these considerations through an analysis of violence
                  and informal networks in an ethnography of immigrant Latinos

                  isometric pictorials on the Purdue Spatial Visualization Test
                  — Visualization of Rotations (Guay, 1977). Undergraduate
                  students enrolled in Graphic Communications courses completed
                  computer versions of the PSVT and the Mental Rotations Test
                  (Vandenberg \& Kuse, 1978) during the first six weeks of
                  classes. The instruments were used to record student responses
                  and response times as well as information on gender, current
                  major, and number of previous graphics courses completed. The
                  control group completed the original version of the PSVT

                  and has been offered each fall since that time. The objective

                  measured. A desktop display as well as the Gear VR were used
                  by the former group and by the latter one, respectively.
                  Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate the
                  relationship between the probability of correct answers and
                  completion times, while linear regression was used to evaluate
                  effects and interactions of following factors on test
                  completion times: the users’ gender and primary hand, test
                  type and device used. The findings were that while the
                  completion times are not significantly affected by the users’
                  primary hand, other factors have significant effects on them:
                  they are decreased by the male gender in itself, while they

                  and their results showed no relationship between the examined
                  spatial abilities and work effectiveness. For navigating in
                  the virtual space, the built-in CogiNav technology of MaxWhere
                  was used. The participants rated their navigational experience

                  ideas about cognition: (1) interacting with tools changes the
                  way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon
                  absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to
                  fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our
                  environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our
                  brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are
                  times when physically performing an activity is better than
                  watching someone else perform the activity, even though our
                  motor resonance system fires strongly during other person
                  observation; (4) there are times when we literallythinkwith
                  things. These four ideas have major implications for
                  interaction design, especially the design of tangible,

               The signaling principle is that people learn better when cues are
               added to highlight the organization of the essential information.

               multimedia lessons include graphics and spoken text rather than
               graphics, spoken text, and printed text. The spatial contiguity

               the process of learning, self-reports of how learners experienced

  abstract  = {In this chapter, I propose three distinct purposes of multiple
               representations and suggest that these lead to different design
               principles and learning activities. Multiple representations can
               play a complementary role when learners exploit differences in
               their form and content by switching between and selecting the
               appropriate representation for the task at hand. Constraining
               benefits are achieved when learners can profit from the support
               of a familiar representation to understand a new and complex
               representation. Finally, if learners abstract across multiple
               representations, they can construct a deeper understanding of the
               nature of the representations and the domain they represent. This
               chapter updates a review of studies that have used multiple
               representations for these purposes and identifies some of the
               circumstances that influence the effectiveness of using multiple

               redundant material interferes with rather than facilitates
               learning. Redundancy is broadly defined as any unnecessary
               information including irrelevant information, the same
               information presented concurrently in multiple forms or in
               unnecessarily elaborated form. According to cognitive load
               theory, processing redundant information with essential
               information increases working memory load which may interfere
               with learning. Eliminating such redundant information removes the
               requirement to process unnecessary sources of information.
               Accordingly, instructional designs that eliminate redundant
               material can be superior to those that include redundancy. This

               while reading text causes generative processing that leads to

               Verbalizing activities involve generating words to distill key
               ideas (learning by summarizing) or make inferences to clarify the
               meaning of the material for oneself (learning by self-explaining)
               or for others (learning by teaching). Visualizing activities

               depict physical structures (learning by drawing) or abstract
               relationships (learning by mapping), or internal mental images
               that depict the content of the lesson (learning by imagining).

               gestures (learning by gesturing) or object manipulations

               By giving due consideration to both perceptual and cognitive

               depends on a number of factors, and in this chapter we focus on
               the content of the feedback message and compare corrective and
               explanatory feedback. Corrective feedback informs learners

               for designing visual displays to improve learning. Specifically,

               via spatial distance, unimportant information, and referential
               confusion) and how to reduce them using research-based principles
               (spatial contiguity principle, coherence principle, and signaling

                  complex, colorful, and entertaining ways that we can think of

                  have not discovered these weaknesses in the manuscripts during

                  remarkable case in which a decimal point error appears to have

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore
                  the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of
                  training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality
                  (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based
                  training is as effective as traditional training methods.
                  BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training
                  tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of
                  whether or not these manipulations are effective for training
                  has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered.
                  Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be
                  time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their
                  efficacy as training tools has been debated. METHOD: The
                  current body of literature was examined and all qualifying
                  articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and
                  AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were
                  calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors,
                  trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on
                  performance measures after XR-based training. RESULTS: Results
                  showed that training in XR does not express a different
                  outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment.
                  It is equally effective at enhancing performance. CONCLUSION:
                  Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities
                  are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly
                  accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing
                  training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods,
                  such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional
                  training impossible.},

                  perspective on constructing the student learning experience.
                  Multimodality is an emergent phenomenon that may influence how
                  digital learning is designed, especially when employed in
                  highly interactive and immersive learning environments such as
                  Virtual Reality (VR). VR environments may aid students'
                  efforts to be active learners through consciously attending
                  to, and reflecting on, critique leveraging reflexivity and
                  novel meaning-making most likely to lead to a conceptual

                  highlight the application of multimodal VR-based teaching and
                  training as a pedagogically rich strategy that may be

                  significance of new ways of embodied meaning making in VR
                  environments is undertheorized—a gap that requires attention
                  given the potential for broadened use of the sensorium in
                  multimodal language and literacy learning. This classroom
                  research investigated multimodal composition using the virtual
                  paint program Google Tilt Brush™ with 47 elementary school
                  students (ages 10–11 years) using a head-mounted display and
                  motion sensors. Multimodal analysis of video, screen capture,
                  and think-aloud data attended to sensory-motor affordances and
                  constraints for embodiment. Modal constraints were the
                  immateriality of the virtual text, virtual disembodiment, and
                  somatosensory mismatch between the virtual and physical
                  worlds. Potentials for new forms of embodied multimodal
                  representation in VR involved extensive bodily, haptic, and
                  locomotive movement. The findings are significant given that
                  research of embodied cognition points to sensorimotor action

                  eighth-grade students from two different classes in a junior
                  high school in Taipei County of Taiwan participated in this
                  study. The current research randomly selected one class as the

                  exchange spatial statements that refer to the objects’
                  positions in the virtual space. If operators are to understand
                  each other, they need to develop a common spatial frame of
                  reference and then choose a space coding to describe the
                  objects’ positions. In this paper, we consider how the content
                  of a virtual environment can influence communication between
                  users. We designed two studies in which one participant (the
                  speaker) had to indicate the position of one object to another
                  participant (the addressee). The virtual environment was
                  sometimes enriched by additional (proximal and distal) visual
                  cues. In study 1, we considered statements production. We
                  observed that the speakers most often used the avatar of their
                  partner as a spatial reference to indicate a localization in
                  the virtual space (i.e., Addressee-Centered coding) despite it
                  increases their mental workload. Nevertheless, in complex
                  situations, they also used distal cues to speak to the
                  addressees (i.e., Exocentric coding of the space). In study 2,
                  we considered statements comprehension. Addressee-Centered
                  coding and Exocentric coding were used by the speakers in
                  various spatial configurations to indicate the object
                  position. We observed that Exocentric coding is the most
                  difficult to manage for the addressee. These results indicate
                  that speakers implemented the principle of less collaborative
                  effort by adopting a way of exchanging information based on an
                  asymmetrical cognitive cost, taking into consideration each
                  other’s difficulties. This allows a balanced mental workload
                  to be maintained between the two operators throughout the
                  task.},

                 industry to create and maintain competent workers;
                 unfortunately, most construction training and education
                 research focuses on university student education. The focus of
                 this dissertation research is the current state of
                 educational-theory embedded construction workforce training,
                 how such trainings are effective, and how they may be further
                 optimized based on established educational theory. This is
                 accomplished through a review of construction training for
                 current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
                 criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the
                 creation of a framework for construction training. There is a
                 lack of recommendations for improvement of construction
                 training across the industry. To establish the current state of
                 construction industry training, a review of education
                 theory-integrated training for construction professionals is
                 undertaken. To measure the extent of educational theory
                 integration, this dissertation summarizes studies that meet
                 inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency of occurrence of
                 Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
                 outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words
                 within the identified construction training literature and
                 foundational educational theory literature. The results provide
                 a baseline of education theory-integrated construction training
                 research, from which gaps and best practices can be identified.
                 Existing construction training programs are not properly
                 measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
                 methodologies used in construction trainings published in
                 archival literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness
                 of training programs. These practices are compared against the
                 Kirkpatrick Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment
                 methodologies in the literature are synthesized with
                 corresponding levels found in the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly
                 integrating educational theory into construction workforce
                 training has the potential to improve industry training;
                 however, there is a dearth of studies that present details of
                 this integration process. To address this gap, a training
                 framework is created to educate material installers on material
                 properties, selection, and installation. This framework is
                 based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
                 principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
                 similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
                 training implementation. The created framework culminates by
                 establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed
                 training modules.},

                  assessment methods to consistently gauge the efficacy of
                  workforce training programs. To address this issue, this study
                  presents a framework for construction industry training
                  assessment that identifies established practices rooted in
                  evaluation science and developed from a review of archival
                  construction industry training literature. Inclusion criteria
                  for the evaluated studies are: archival training studies
                  focused on the construction industry workforce and integration
                  of educational theory in training creation or implementation.
                  Literature meeting these criteria are summarized and a case
                  review is presented detailing assessment practices and
                  results. The assessment practices are then synthesized with
                  the Kirkpatrick Model to analyze how closely industry
                  assessment corresponds with established training evaluation
                  standards. The study culminates in a training assessment

                  identified studies, established survey writing practices, and
                  the Kirkpatrick Model. This study found that two-thirds of

                  interviews to assess training efficacy, two studies that used
                  questionnaires to assess training efficacy provided question
                  text, three studies measured learning by administering tests

                  with vivid sensory information that allow them to embody
                  another person's perceptual experiences. Three experiments
                  explored whether embodied experiences via IVET would elicit
                  greater self-other merging, favorable attitudes, and helping
                  toward persons with disabilities compared to traditional
                  perspective taking, which relies on imagination to put the
                  self in another person's shoes. Trait dispositions to feel
                  concern for others was tested as a moderating variable.
                  Participants in the embodied experiences (EE) condition were
                  exposed to a red-green colorblind simulation using IVET while
                  participants in the perspective taking (PT) condition were
                  exposed to a normal colored IVET world and instructed to
                  imagine being colorblind. Experiment 1 compared EE against PT
                  and found that EE was effective for participants with lower
                  tendencies to feel concern for others 24 hours after
                  treatment. Experiment 2 delved further into the underlying
                  process of EE and confirmed that a heightened sense of realism
                  during the EE led to greater self-other merging compared to
                  PT. Finally, Experiment 3 demonstrated that the effect of EE
                  transferred into the physical world, leading participants to
                  voluntarily spend twice as much effort to help persons with

                  as a method in educational studies and exposes evidence for
                  the neglect of this method in religious education research in
                  particular. It argues that historical inquiry, as a
                  counterpart to other research methods, can add depth and range
                  to our understanding of education, including religious
                  education, and can illuminate important longer‐term, broader
                  and philosophical issues. The article also argues that many
                  historical voices have remained silent in the existing
                  historiography of religious education because such
                  historiography is too generalised and too biased towards the
                  development of national policy and curriculum and pedagogical
                  theory. To address this limitation in educational research,
                  this article promotes rigorous historical studies that are

                  be fruitfully applied to a particular contemporary debate

  abstract     = {As medical education research continues to diversify
                  methodologically and theoretically, medical education
                  researchers have been increasingly willing to challenge
                  taken-for-granted assumptions about the form, content and
                  function of medical education. In this AMEE guide we describe
                  historical, discourse and text analysis approaches that can
                  help researchers and educators question the inevitability of
                  things that are currently seen as 'natural'. Why is such
                  questioning important? By articulating our assumptions and
                  interrogating the 'naturalness' of the status quo, one can
                  then begin to ask why things are the way they are. Researchers
                  can, for example, ask whether the models of medical education
                  organization and delivery that currently seem 'natural' to
                  them have been developed in order to provide the most benefit
                  to students or patients--or whether they have, rather, been
                  developed in ways that provide power to faculty members,
                  medical schools or the medical profession as a whole. An
                  understanding of the interplay of practices and power is a
                  valuable tool for opening up the field to new possibilities
                  for better medical education. The recognition that our current
                  models, rather than being 'natural', were created in
                  particular historical contexts for any number of contingent
                  reasons leads inexorably to the possibility of change. For if
                  our current ways of doing things are not, in fact, inevitable,
                  not only can they be questioned, they can be made better; they
                  can changed in ways that are attentive to whom they benefit,
                  are congruent with our current beliefs about best practice and
                  may lead to the production of better doctors.},

                  research proposals. Adopting an ethnographic and hermeneutic
                  methodology, the present paper draws upon our experiences as
                  lecturers in Research Methods over many years, and upon
                  pertinent literature to explain the meaning of research

  abstract     = {The ‘traditional’ construction industry has constantly been
                  challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices.
                  Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods
                  of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to
                  help improve construction industry performance as well as meet
                  new market demands through the provision of improved,
                  adaptable, and sustainable buildings. However, the deployment
                  of OSP systems, if not managed properly, may adversely affect
                  the end result and be counterproductive. It is therefore
                  imperative that the construction industry stakeholders learn
                  and appreciate the specifics, merits, as well as the risks
                  associated with OSP systems in order to achieve the desired
                  outcomes and consequently improve industry
                  performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to
                  facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to be
                  particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
                  granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been
                  criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid
                  of the actual training context. In order to address the
                  problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR)
                  solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such
                  VR solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free
                  environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
                  often faced on real construction projects. The proffered
                  solution provides a unique VR environment for practicing new
                  working conditions associated with OSP practices. While the
                  ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on a construction
                  site, the environment predominantly targets professionals,
                  such as project managers, construction managers, architects,
                  designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
                  multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
                  ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
                  environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
                  professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
                  issues to occur; where the implications of which can be
                  evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR
                  environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
                  associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go
                  wrong’ and consequently allows users not only to ‘experience’
                  the resulting implications but also to reflect on those
                  implications as part of the learning process. This paper
                  discusses and presents the prototype for the first development
                  phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the
                  prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
                  industry, the research community, and academia from different
                  EU countries, the data used in developing the prototype was
                  constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the
                  generalisability of results.},

                  computer games has the positive effect of enhancing student's
                  visual selective attention. But that finding is just one small
                  part of a more important message that all parents and
                  educators need to hear: Video games are not the enemy, but the
                  best opportunity we have to engage our kids in real learning.},

               and societal relevance of the construction industry, the chapter
               focuses on its current labor productivity and safety issues,
               along with the new megatrends that are affecting the
               architecture. engineering, construction, and operation (AECO)
               sector in the third millennium. Energy and environment impacts of

  abstract     = {Abstract The UK construction industry has long been criticized
                  for its poor performance, poor image and inability to attract
                  and retain workers. Offsite production (OSP) under the
                  overarching umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC)
                  was sought by the UK Government to ameliorate the UK
                  construction industry, meet market demands and overcome manual
                  skill shortages. Nevertheless, professional skills shortages
                  are argued to be as acute as manual skills shortfalls. In this
                  respect, industry?academia collaboration is anticipated to
                  provide professional skills needed for OSP and, hence, effect
                  change. This paper reports the findings from the first stage
                  of an ongoing triangulated research project. In this context,
                  a survey was carried out to capture the perceptions of both
                  the UK construction industry and academia with respect to OSP
                  and preferable means for collaboration, in an attempt to
                  explore common grounds for possible collaborations. A
                  quantitative approach was primarily used for data collection
                  and analysis. The findings from 36 large construction
                  organizations (representing a 20\% response rate) and 20
                  construction-related higher-education institutions
                  (representing a 32\% response rate) suggested that although
                  the industry considered OSP to be the future of the UK
                  construction industry, there seemed to be uncertainty about
                  what OSP actually entailed. Notwithstanding these issues,
                  academia either did not know or refuted that OSP is the future
                  of the construction industry, hence suggesting a lack of
                  shared understanding between industry and academia with
                  respect to skills requirements and preferred means for
                  collaboration. Further research is needed to bridge the gap
                  between these apparent polarized views.},

               Other manufacturing sectors such as aerospace and automotive

               that can be configured and assembled to provide a specific
               product or service. Open building manufacturing is an attempt to
               bring some of the salient features of efficient manufacturing to
               the construction sector. This should allow for significant
               savings in construction and maintenance costs, fewer errors and
               rework, more choices and value to the customer, new products and
               services that can be configured and assembled in mobile factories
               at construction sites, etc., as is reported in different chapters

               based on constructivism, aiming at cultivating students'
               problem-solving ability and autonomous learning ability. Lots of
               researches have studied scaffolding concerning subjects of
               biology and engineering, what lacks from such researches is the
               scaffolding designed in English teaching, especially in the
               support of information technology. In particular, information
               technology-based scaffolding is also scarce in the foreign
               language teaching. In order to bridge the gap, this paper
               introduced the results of a case study in which the students of
               primary school participate in the making of animation learning
               resources in English subject by using an animation production
               tool. Findings suggest that the student participants' perform
               better after participating in the process of making the situated
               animation resources. And most importantly, the resources they
               designed are intended to be reused and restored by facilitating
               the management and sharing. The article concludes with a
               discussion of the implications of the findings for improving the
               performance of students. It gives a new thought for the
               scaffolding from the perspective of students and provides them
               scaffolding learning experience thus improving learning
               motivation and cognition.},

               systems and software tutorials often teach procedures with

               typically authored by hand, and little can be reused across

               generating interactive tutorials from an algorithmic
               representation of the problem-solving thought process. Given a
               set of mappings between programming language constructs and user

               to trigger visual explanations of each step. This approach allows
               us to automatically generate tutorials for any example problem
               that can be solved with this algorithm. We describe two prototype
               implementations in the domains of K-12 mathematics and
               educational games, and present results from two user studies

               of new object-space techniques for high-fidelity pen-and-ink

                  in articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical

               4.0 is based on a confluence of trends and technologies that
               promise to reshape the way built environment assets are designed,
               constructed, and operated. With the pervasive use of Building
               Information Modelling (BIM), lean principles, digital
               technologies, and offsite construction, the industry is at the
               cusp of this transformation. The critical challenge is the
               fragmented state of teaching, research, and professional practice
               in the built environment sector. This handbook aims to overcome
               this fragmentation by describing Construction 4.0 in the context
               of its current state, emerging trends and technologies, and the
               people and process issues that surround the coming

  abstract  = {Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been widely applied to a
               diverse range of psychopathology. CBT, as it exists today, is a
               composite of techniques derived from behavioral, cognitive, and
               social learning theories. Behavioral learning principles underlie
               exposure therapy, one of the most efficacious interventions to
               date, as well as a handful of diverse CBT interventions, which
               apply principles of reinforcement to decrease maladaptive
               behaviors. Cognitive strategies within CBT utilize principles
               from theories of constructivism, attribution theory, and
               metacognition to aid clients in learning how thoughts impact
               feelings. Finally, social learning theory, which focuses on
               learning in the context of interpersonal relationships,
               interactions, and observations, plays a role in CBT, relying
               heavily upon both therapist instruction and the active role of
               the participant. This chapter provides an overview of how these

  abstract     = {Since January 1, 2007, Government legislation in Western
                  Australia required all workers in construction to complete
                  mandatory safety awareness training before they began work on
                  site. During the implementation of this new legislation there
                  was considerable resistance from the construction sector due
                  to the mandatory nature of the training. The construction
                  industry viewed this as an unnecessary impost as they
                  considered that there was already sufficient safety training
                  delivered through individual company and site inductions. In
                  2010, we evaluated the new Construction Induction Training
                  (CIT) in the commercial construction sector in Western
                  Australia to find that since 2007 there has been an
                  unanticipated change in support for the mandatory training.
                  The 2010 study shows a shift in the values of the safety
                  culture for the commercial sector of the construction
                  industry. In 2010, the industry not only supports the
                  mandatory CIT, but is very vocal in its request to
                  re-institute the refresher courses that were withdrawn in
                  2009. Indeed, 79\% of respondents claimed there were
                  measurable benefits to their business having their employees
                  complete the CIT, while 96\% claimed the CIT assisted in
                  reducing accidents/incidents on their worksites. This 2010
                  study indicates that in this case, mandatory training has had
                  a positive effect on safety culture change and gradually
                  reduced work-related injury in the industry since 2007 to the
                  present. The paper uses data from two studies conducted in
                  2006 and 2010 to highlight the unanticipated change in
                  perception of the value of mandatory safety training in the WA
                  construction industry to one which is positive and supportive.},

                  the neural processes that support performance. For example,
                  performing a specific action improves the execution of that
                  action via changes in associated sensory and motor neural
                  circuitry, and experience using language improves language
                  comprehension by altering the anatomy and physiology of
                  perisylvian neocortical brain regions. Here we provide
                  evidence that specialized (sports) motor experience enhances
                  action-related language understanding by recruitment of left
                  dorsal lateral premotor cortex, a region normally devoted to
                  higher-level action selection and implementation-even when
                  there is no intention to perform a real action. Experience
                  playing and watching sports has enduring effects on language
                  understanding by changing the neural networks that subserve
                  comprehension to incorporate areas active in performing sports
                  skills. Without such experience, sport novices recruit
                  lower-level sensory-motor regions, thought to support the
                  instantiation of movement, during language processing, and
                  activity in primary motor areas does not help comprehension.
                  Thus, the language system is sufficiently plastic and dynamic
                  to encompass expertise-related neural recruitment outside core
                  language networks.},

                  methods. Complex and intricate digital technologies and mobile
                  computing such as simulation, computational design and
                  immersive technologies, have been exploited for different
                  purposes such as reducing cost and time, improving design and
                  enhancing overall project efficiency. Immersive technologies
                  and augmented reality (AR), in particular, have proven to be
                  extremely beneficial in this field. However, the application
                  and usage of these technologies and devices in higher
                  education teaching and learning environments are yet to be
                  fully explored and still scarce. More importantly, there is
                  still a significant gap in developing pedagogies and teaching
                  methods that embrace the usage of such technologies in the AC

  abstract     = {IN ANCIENT times, teaching and learning were accomplished
                  through apprenticeship: We taught our children how to speak,
                  grow crops, craft cabinets, or tailor clothes by showing them
                  how and by helping them do it. Apprenticeship was the vehicle
                  for transmitting the knowledge required for expert practice in
                  fields from painting and sculpting to medicine and law. It was
                  the natural way to learn. In modern times, apprenticeship has
                  largely been replaced by formal schooling, except in
                  children's learning of language, in some aspects of graduate
                  education, and in on-the-job training. We propose an
                  alternative model of instruction that is accessible within the
                  framework of the typical American classroom. It is a model of
                  instruction that goes back to apprenticeship but incorporates
                  elements of schooling. We call this model "cognitive
                  apprenticeship" While there are many differences between
                  schooling and apprenticeship methods, we will focus on one. In
                  apprenticeship, learners can see the processes of work: They
                  watch a parent sow, plant, and harvest crops and help as they
                  are able; they assist a tradesman as he crafts a cabinet; they
                  piece together garments under the supervision of a more
                  experienced tailor. Apprenticeship involves learning a
                  physical, tangible activity. But in schooling, the "practice"
                  of problem solving, reading comprehension, and writing is not
                  at all obvious-it is not necessarily observable to the
                  student. In apprenticeship, the processes of the activity are
                  visible. In schooling, the processes of thinking are often
                  invisible to both the students and the teacher. Cognitive
                  apprenticeship is a model of instruction that works to make
                  thinking visible. In this article, we will present some of the
                  features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss the ways it
                  can be adapted to the teaching and learning of cognitive
                  skills. Then we will present three successful examples-cases
                  in which teachers and researchers have used apprenticeship
                  methods to teach reading, writing, and mathematics. In the
                  final section, we organize our ideas about the characteristics
                  of successful teaching into a general framework for the design
                  of learning environments, where "environment" includes the
                  content taught, the pedagogical methods employed, the
                  sequencing of learning activities, and the sociology of
                  learning. Although schools have been relatively successful in
                  organizing and conveying large bodies of conceptual and
                  factual knowledge, standard pedagogical practices render key

               in practice, it has had much less impact on the HCI research
               community. In this paper we propose a new model for interaction
               design research within HCI. Following a research through design
               approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research in
               an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms the
               world from its current state to a preferred state. This model
               allows interaction designers to make research contributions based
               on their strength in addressing under-constrained problems. To
               formalize this model, we provide a set of four lenses for
               evaluating the research contribution and a set of three examples

                  characterization of design, we focus on the guiding values or
                  ideals of the discipline. We first reason from the notion of
                  engineering interfaces for usability and utility up to the
                  1990s to the current ideal of designing interfaces for
                  experience and meaning. Next, we identify three recent
                  technical and societal developments that are challenging the
                  existing ideals of interaction design, namely the move towards
                  hybrid physical/digital materials, the emergence of an
                  increasingly complex and fluid digital ecology, and the
                  increasing proportion of autonomous or partially autonomous
                  systems changing their behavior over time and with use. These
                  challenges in turn motivate us to propose three directions in
                  which new ideals for interaction design might be sought: the
                  first is to go beyond the language-body divide that implicitly
                  frames most of our current understandings of experience and
                  meaning, the second is to extend the scope of interaction
                  design from individual interfaces to the complex
                  sociotechnical fabric of human and nonhuman actors, and the
                  third is to go beyond predictability by learning to design
                  with machine learning.},

                  shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
                  construction sector in the European Union Member States,
                  foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of
                  people is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which
                  also includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages
                  in the EU are expected to increase in the future due to a
                  declining population and an ageing workforce. In order to
                  recognize and forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use
                  a variety of instruments but they do not answer as to whether
                  it is possible to use migrant labour to appease those
                  shortages. There are several systems used to classify labour
                  shortages in the EU Member states. Most of the countries
                  classify labour shortages in relation to different sectors or
                  occupation groups as well as by skill levels, but in some
                  Member States, classification is made according to the type of
                  employment. Instruments used to measure labour shortages
                  significantly differ from country to country. Several criteria
                  are used for creating lists of shortage occupations and most
                  of the criteria include demand side and supply side criteria.
                  A majority of the Member States are facing labour and skill
                  shortages in various sectors and the construction sector is
                  not an exception. As total employment in the construction
                  sector decreased, so did the share of employed migrants.
                  Labour shortages in the construction sector can be eased by
                  the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
                  unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
                  low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
                  the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be
                  working, which has an impact on the development and
                  implementation dynamic of Construction 4.0.},

                  not spared the Malaysian business landscape. This has
                  compelled industries to produce highly skilled workforce
                  (Yizit and Yezim Denis, 2018) to promote knowledge-based
                  skills in various sectors in Malaysia. Anticipating this
                  change, the Malaysian Government initiated Technical
                  Vocational Education and Training (TVET) program to address
                  the issue during the early 90’s. However, the current highly
                  pedagogical supply driven TVET system has not addressed the
                  need to effectively upskill and reskill workforce talents to
                  achieve maximum productivity. Hence, this study, which is
                  grounded on empowerment theory, aims to develop mechanisms to
                  skew the path towards industry-driven TVET by adopting
                  heutagogical approaches that promotes lifelong and independent
                  adult learning (Blaschke, 2012). The study will be executed

  abstract   = {Construction 4.0 is the adoption and adaptation of the Industry
                4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
                to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
                digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
                authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
                fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
                constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
                developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
                the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal
                fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to the
                improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a literature
                review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the construction
                sector was undertaken. Based on this systematic literature
                review, the authors define the Construction 4.0 framework and
                provide its benefits and barriers to implementation. A key
                finding of the study is that building information modeling, and
                a common data environment form the key foundation for the
                implementation of the Construction 4.0 framework. In defining
                the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper described its
                components and how its implementation is likely to proceed. The
                authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0, the industry
                can transform itself into a highly efficient, quality-centered,
                and safe industry capable of successfully delivering the demands
                placed on it by society.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, Industry 4.0 has been introduced as a popular
                  term to describe the trend towards digitisation and automation
                  of the manufacturing environment. Despite its potential
                  benefits in terms of improvements in productivity and quality,
                  this concept has not gained much attention in the construction
                  industry. This development is founded in the fact that the
                  far-reaching implications of the increasingly digitised and
                  automated manufacturing environment are still widely unknown.
                  Against this backdrop, the primary objective of this paper is
                  to explore the state of the art as well as the state of
                  practice of Industry 4.0 relating technologies in the

                  accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
                  approach to be the most important means of bringing about
                  improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
                  research and the weaknesses of existing preventative
                  approaches and then to describe and illustrate a new
                  application involving the use of a multi‐dimensional
                  simulation tool – Construction Virtual Prototyping
                  (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA literature review was
                  conducted to investigate previous studies of hazard
                  identification and safety management and to develop the new
                  approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the research
                  study explored the use of computer simulation techniques to
                  create virtual environments where users can explore and
                  identify construction hazards. Specifically, virtual
                  prototyping technology was deployed to develop typical
                  construction scenarios in which unsafe or hazardous incidents
                  occur. In a case study, the users' performance was evaluated
                  based on their responses to incidents within the virtual
                  environment and the effectiveness of the computer simulation
                  system established though interviews with the safety project
                  management team.FindingsThe opinions and suggestions provided
                  by the interviewees led to the initial conclusion that the
                  simulation tool was useful in assisting the safety management
                  team's hazard identification process during the early design
                  stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an innovative
                  method to support the management team's reviews of
                  construction site safety. The system utilises
                  three‐dimensional modelling and four‐dimensional simulation of
                  worker behaviour, a configuration that has previously not been
                  employed in construction simulations. An illustration of the
                  method's use is also provided, together with a consideration
                  of its strengths and weaknesses.},

  abstract     = {In 1965 a political initiative was taken launched to solve the
                  lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
                  about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
                  programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
                  entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal
                  value. Today they do not always meet current building
                  standards and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million
                  Homes programme incorporated a large variety of technical
                  building solutions, andknowledge about former building
                  practices is needed if refurbishment is to be successful.
                  Industrialised builders in Sweden have recognized the use of a
                  platform as one means of sharing knowledge. A platform is
                  essentially the collection of assets that are shared by a set
                  of products. In a platform for housing refurbishment the
                  assets have knowledge and process content (as opposed to
                  product content) and will probably also contain many
                  relationships. The interview study carried out as part of the
                  research shows that the main purpose of a platform concept is
                  to standardize components and processes. To increase the
                  possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
                  buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should
                  be on the individuals who will actually be sharing their

                  implemented in construction engineering education and training
                  (CEET) in recent years due to its benefits of providing an
                  engaging and immersive environment. The objective of this
                  review is to critically collect and analyze the VR
                  applications in CEET, aiming at all VR-related journal papers
                  published from 1997 to 2017. The review follows a three-stage
                  analysis on VR technologies, applications and future
                  directions through a systematic analysis. It is found that the
                  VR technologies adopted for CEET evolve over time, from
                  desktop-based VR, immersive VR, 3D game-based VR, to Building
                  Information Modelling (BIM)-enabled VR. A sibling technology,
                  Augmented Reality (AR), for CEET adoptions has also emerged in
                  recent years. These technologies have been applied in
                  architecture and design visualization, construction health and
                  safety training, equipment and operational task training, as
                  well as structural analysis. Future research directions,
                  including the integration of VR with emerging education
                  paradigms and visualization technologies, have also been
                  provided. The findings are useful for both researchers and
                  educators to usefully integrate VR in their education and
                  training programs to improve the training performance.},

                  technologies, intelligent systems have received widespread
                  attention in many industries and have brought the potential to
                  improve the efficiency of the construction industry. These
                  facts led to the appearance of a new concept in construction
                  industry called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article
                  seeks to explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0
                  technologies in the construction industry and analyze their
                  impact on the formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In
                  order to achieve the aim of this article, a literature review
                  was conducted using the most relevant publication in this
                  field. Moreover, authors carried out a bibliometric analysis
                  among 195 selected research articles related to the Industry
                  4.0 and Construction 4.0 to identify interconnections between
                  these concepts. The results show that Industry 4.0 has the
                  greatest impact on productivity growth in construction and
                  that interest in digital technologies is growing every year,
                  but their penetration into the construction industry is
                  currently slow and limited. The authors suggest that further
                  research needs to be focused on future ethical issues that may

                  strategy is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer
                  their design to different degrees, resulting in variations of
                  the engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order,
                  adapt-to-order, and engineer-to-stock. This variation causes
                  different settings for the use of platforms in house-building.
                  The aim of this research is to diversify the engineer-to-order
                  production strategy and its consequences for platform
                  organization by studying its use in house-building. The
                  multiple case study on four engineering/contractor firms
                  reports the core capabilities for engineer-to-order firms:
                  procurement and tendering, market knowledge, engineering,
                  multi-skilled manufacturing, and coordination of sales and
                  manufacturing. Design-to-order, adapt-to-order and engineer-to
                  stock were shown to be production strategies in use in
                  house-building. In design-to-order platforms parts of the
                  platform are undefined while engineer-to-stock platforms are
                  fully predefined. Coordination between market and
                  manufacturing is a crucial capability when engaging in
                  platform organization. When an engineering firm and a
                  contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the
                  coordination capability between market and manufacturing was
                  shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized
                  contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific
                  market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while
                  contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization
                  of processes rather than products.},

                  theory of learning? 'To the extent that being human is a
                  relational matter, generated in social living, historically,
                  in social formations whose participants engage with each other
                  as a condition and precondition for their existence, theories
                  that conceive of learning as a special universal mental
                  process impoverish and misrecognize it. My colleagues and I
                  have been trying to convey out understanding of this claim for
                  some years (e.g., Lave, 1988; Lave the absence of movement
                  away from some putatively common starting point becomes
                  grounds for labeling others sub-normal. The logic that makes
                  success exceptional but nonetheless characterizes lack of
                  success as not normal won't do. It reflects and contributes to
                  a politics by which disinherited and disenfranchised
                  individuals, whether taken one at a time or in masses, are
                  identified as the disabled, and thereby made responsible for
                  their "plight" (e.g., McDermott, 1993). It seems imperative to
                  explore ways of understanding learning that do not naturalize
                  and underwrite divisions of social inequality in our society.
                  A reconsideration of learning as a social, collective, rather
                  than individual, psychological phenomenon offers the only way
                  beyond the current state of affairs that I can envision at the

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: There is a mismatch between the broad range of
                  learning theories offered in the wider education literature
                  and a relatively narrow range of theories privileged in the
                  medical education literature. The latter are usually described
                  under the heading of 'adult learning theory'. METHODS: This
                  paper critically addresses the limitations of the current
                  dominant learning theories informing medical education. An
                  argument is made that such theories, which address how an
                  individual learns, fail to explain how learning occurs in
                  dynamic, complex and unstable systems such as fluid clinical
                  teams. RESULTS: Models of learning that take into account
                  distributed knowing, learning through time as well as space,
                  and the complexity of a learning environment including
                  relationships between persons and artefacts, are more powerful
                  in explaining and predicting how learning occurs in clinical
                  teams. Learning theories may be privileged for ideological
                  reasons, such as medicine's concern with autonomy.
                  CONCLUSIONS: Where an increasing amount of medical education
                  occurs in workplace contexts, sociocultural learning theories
                  offer a best-fit exploration and explanation of such learning.
                  We need to continue to develop testable models of learning
                  that inform safe work practice. One type of learning theory
                  will not inform all practice contexts and we need to think
                  about a range of fit-for-purpose theories that are testable in
                  practice. Exciting current developments include dynamicist
                  models of learning drawing on complexity theory.},

  abstract     = {A curriculum innovation for a new UK medical school -
                  Peninsula, launched in 2002 - was grounded in a period of
                  radical pedagogical innovation in medical education in the UK
                  during the 1990s. Part of this thinking was to include the
                  medical humanities as a medium for re-thinking medical
                  practice, especially how medical students might better learn
                  to communicate with patients and colleagues, and how they
                  might become agents of change in progressing medicine through
                  innovations. In designing the curriculum, Cultural-historical
                  Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as a model to 'think', or
                  reconceptualise, the purposes of a curriculum. The first
                  question asked was: 'what do patients want?' Emphasis was
                  placed on resisting a 'will-to-stability' in adopting safe
                  curriculum process, in favour of adopting a 'possibility
                  knowledge' framework that celebrated dialogue. This operated
                  through three 'spearheads', or radical aims: democratic
                  habits, towards the feminine, and tender-mindedness.},

  abstract  = {In this important theoretical treatist, Jean Lave,
               anthropologist, and Etienne Wenger, computer scientist, push
               forward the notion of situated learning - that learning is
               fundamentally a social process. The authors maintain that
               learning viewed as situated activity has as its central defining
               characteristic a process they call legitimate peripheral
               participation (LPP). Learners participate in communities of
               practitioners, moving toward full participation in the
               sociocultural practices of a community. LPP provides a way to
               speak about crucial relations between newcomers and old-timers
               and about their activities, identities, artefacts, knowledge and
               practice. The communities discussed in the book are midwives,
               tailors, quartermasters, butchers, and recovering alcoholics,
               however, the process by which participants in those communities
               learn can be generalised to other social groups.},

  abstract     = {The concept of human capital is very common in present-day
                  construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
                  techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in
                  different fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to
                  another. This study provides a detailed discussion on the
                  development of the human capital theory under various themes
                  and sub-themes. The study further seeks to discuss the several
                  effects of human capital development on industry success and
                  competitiveness and how this contributes to economic growth in
                  developing countries. Relevant literatures on HC theory and
                  development were extracted from Scopus. Scopus is widely
                  acknowledged as one of the widest interdisciplinary databases
                  for engineering, technology, science and medicine. The Scopus
                  database features over 20, 000+ peer-reviewed journals from
                  over 5000 publishers. The Scopus database allows its users to
                  perform more detailed searching opportunities compared to
                  other databases such as Academic Search Complete, Art and
                  Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink and Web of
                  science. The distillation of literature through thematic
                  analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and its
                  correlation with construction industry success and growth.
                  Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
                  construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness
                  of its human capital. The study revealed that the human
                  capital theory is not without its criticisms and barriers.
                  Practically, this study explores the various benefits of human
                  capital to employers of the construction industry. The study
                  suggests that human capital development plays a key part in
                  retaining quality employees and recruiting prospects.
                  Furthermore, investment in human capital goes a long way in
                  improving employee satisfaction, organisational culture and
                  increased productivity. This study contributes to the human
                  capital discourse, which is the measure of economic value
                  provided by employees with reference to their abilities,
                  skills, values and knowledge.},

  abstract     = {The construction industry has traditionally been characterised
                  by the high diversity of its agents and processes, high
                  resistance to change and low incorporation of technology
                  compared to manufacturing industries. However, the
                  construction sector is experiencing now a strong renovation
                  process in methodology and tools due to the incorporation of
                  the Building Information Modelling, Lean Construction and
                  Integrated Project Delivery. Meanwhile, in production systems,
                  “Industry 4.0” is a new paradigm that proposes automation,
                  monitoring, sensorisation, robotisation, and digitalisation to
                  improve production and distribution processes. In this
                  context, some authors have proposed the concept of
                  “Construction 4.0” as the counterpart of Industry 4.0 for the
                  construction sector, although the methodological-technological
                  implications are not clear. This research shows a
                  methodological-technological framework adapted to the
                  Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations
                  industry. This papers includes a detailed proposal for a
                  reference frameworks and related technologies that could
                  impact on this sector, responding to its complexities and
                  specific challenges, such as the unique spaces for each work,
                  which are difficult to standardise, arbitrary cost overruns
                  and a productivity far below the average for other industries,
                  increasing competitiveness and globalisation, as opposed to
                  its traditionally local deployment, and an increasing demand
                  to reduce the carbon footprint for all its activities.},

                  processes and work methods, and the advancement of new
                  technologies in recent decades has led to a new concept known
                  as Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its
                  definition is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to
                  conduct a review on the publications in this field to grasp
                  how this concept is being understood. For that purpose, a
                  bibliometric analysis was conducted among 260 research
                  articles using seven keywords. The results reveal that the
                  number of publications is growing exponentially, with the USA,
                  the UK, and China being leaders in this field; besides, four
                  technologies are essential to understand Construction 4.0 at
                  present time: 3D printing, big data, virtual reality, and
                  Internet of Things. The results of this review suggest that
                  further reviews should be conducted every 3 years to grasp the
                  rapid evolution of Construction 4.0.},

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose careers
               and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It utilizes
               a wide variety of sources, including novels from the period, to
               produce a lively narrative.},

                  construction and related industry workers in the state. This
                  study presents methods for determining the needs and
                  developing the curricula for workforce development.
                  Methodology is examined for its effectiveness in addressing an
                  ongoing societal need. A series of curricula was developed for
                  the purpose of retraining the State?s workforce in new and
                  emerging green construction jobs. Research limitations and

               Methodology has reimagined, redesigned, and fully renovated how a
               textbook can help students achieve success in their methods
               course or research project. Eight steps: Foolproof for any
               beginner researcher, the book breaks the process of designing and
               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional
               material including research articles, readings, case studies,
               activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to pursue your
               curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your assignments. With
               this one book, every student gets what they need to succeed. It
               is the perfect essential text for students and beginner
               researchers across the social sciences.},

  abstract     = {In response to impending skills shortages and changing
                  employment patterns, the UK construction industry recently has
                  made considerable efforts to attract more women to its
                  professions. However, despite their increasing representation,
                  there are indications that women experience difficulties in
                  developing their careers within the industry. This research
                  investigated the careers of men and women working for large
                  construction companies, in order to establish the gender
                  determined influences on women's career progression. A
                  primarily qualitative methodology was employed for the
                  research, in which career profiles were developed through
                  ethnographic interviews with 41 matched pairs of male and
                  female employees. This allowed the gender specific
                  determinants of careers to be established across a range of
                  different organizations, and from informants at different
                  vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis resulted in the
                  formulation of a set of eight interrelated theoretical models,
                  from which a theory of women's career development was
                  constructed. The theory reflects the belief that the
                  construction workplace is a competitive and conflictual
                  environment, where women are overtly and covertly
                  discriminated against by men, who use structural systems to
                  undermine their participation. The women interviewed were
                  found to have dealt with these barriers in a way which
                  perpetuated existing work cultures. If reflected throughout
                  the industry, this would suggest the existence of a
                  self-fulfilling cycle of women's continued under-achievement.
                  The paper puts forward the radical proposition that women
                  should not be attracted to the industry unless steps are taken
                  to moderate its exclusionary and discriminatory culture.},

  abstract     = {Construction crisis management research is in an exploratory
                  state where contemplated questions are of more value than
                  hasty answers. For this reason, this paper is more concerned
                  with theory formulation than theory testing. More
                  specifically, it derives a grounded theory of construction
                  crisis management which forms a useful basis for future
                  research. It does so from an investigation of the complex
                  patterns of communication and behaviour which emerge in
                  response to construction crises. The conclusion is that
                  construction crisis management is about the effective control
                  of social and behavioural instability and the conflict which
                  arises out of it. However, effective crisis management is made
                  difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms which
                  construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory also
                  is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
                  thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
                  context is identified.},

                  to capture rich information for the purpose of the
                  investigation by allowing the investigators to retain the
                  holistic and meaningful characteristics of real?life events.
                  Subsequent to data capture, data analysis will take place
                  according to the intended research methodology. However, there
                  is a potential for certain information to be hidden within the
                  data and diluted during this data analysis phase. In order to
                  minimize this and to reveal informal aspects and freshly
                  emerging themes from the case study data, it is proposed that
                  there is great value in analysing case studies on various
                  levels, through different phases using multiple methods.
                  Examples of the outcomes of applying multiple analyses
                  involving different approaches, such as grounded theory
                  methodology, rich picture diagrams and cognitive mapping, to
                  the same set of data from multiple case studies are presented

                  study research of construction projects provides valuable
                  insights by revealing informal aspects and stimulating the
                  emergence of a fresh understanding of the processes and
                  interactions among different stakeholders. From the findings,
                  the limits of the formal management systems were revealed.
                  Further, the limits of tacit understanding around an evolving
                  shared vision for a project were found to be substantial
                  dimensions in understanding construction projects in a more

                  sense of educational practice. Multiple theories can inform
                  our understanding of a single concept, in this case:
                  veterinary workplace clinical training (WCT), which occurs
                  just prior to students' graduation as competent veterinary
                  surgeons. The competency movement has strongly influenced
                  reforms in veterinary education and is considered important.
                  In reflection of this, the term "preparedness" is
                  operationalised here as a measure of the likelihood that the
                  veterinary student is going to be a competent learner and
                  participant during WCT. Preparedness itself is therefore
                  important because it directly impacts performance. Workplace
                  clinical training is explored through the lenses of
                  cognitivist, social constructivist and socio-culturalist
                  learning theories and used to inform student preparedness

  abstract     = {Even though tightened building energy efficiency standards are
                  implemented periodically in many countries, existing buildings
                  continually consume a momentous quota of the total primary
                  energy. Energy efficiency solutions range from material
                  components to bulk systems. A technique of building
                  construction, referred to as prefabricated architecture
                  (prefab), is increasing in reputation. Prefab encompasses the
                  offsite fabrication of building components to a greater degree
                  of finish as bulk building structures and systems, and their
                  assembly on-site. In this context, prefab improves the speed
                  of construction, quality of architecture, efficiency of
                  materials, and worker safety, while limiting environmental
                  impacts of construction, as compared to conventional
                  site-built construction practices. Quite recently, a 57 story
                  skyscraper was built in 19 days using prefabricated modules.
                  From the building physics point of view, the bulk systems and
                  tighter integration method of prefab minimizes thermal
                  bridges. This study seeks to clearly characterize the levels
                  of prefab and to investigate the performance of modular
                  prefab; considering acoustic constrain, seismic resistance,
                  thermal behavior, energy consumption, and life cycle analysis
                  of existing prefab cases and, thus, provides a dynamic case
                  study-based review. Generally, prefab can be categorized into
                  components, panels (2D), modules (3D), hybrids, and unitized
                  whole buildings. On average, greenhouse gas emissions from
                  conventional construction were higher than for modular
                  construction, not discounting some individual discrepancies.
                  Few studies have focused on monitored data on prefab and
                  occupants’ comfort but additional studies are required to
                  understand the public’s perception of the technology. The
                  scope of the work examined will be of interest to building
                  engineers, manufacturers, and energy experts, as well as serve
                  as a foundational reference for future study.},

                  argues that 'the social' does not exist as a single spatial
                  type, but rather performs itself in a recursive and
                  topologically heterogeneous manner. Using material drawn from
                  a study of the way in which tropical doctors handle anaemia,
                  it explores three different social topologies. First, there
                  are 'regions' in which objects are clustered together, and
                  boundaries are drawn round each cluster. Second, there are
                  'networks' in which distance is a function of relations
                  between elements, and difference a matter of relational
                  variety. These two forms of spatiality are often mobilized in
                  social theory. However, we argue that there are other kinds of
                  social space, and here consider the possible character of a
                  third, that of 'fluid spatiality'. In this, places are neither
                  delineated by boundaries, nor linked through stable relations:
                  instead, entities may be similar and dissimilar at different
                  locations within fuid space. In addition, they may transform
                  themselves without creating difference.},

                  models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
                  (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased
                  capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to
                  LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations
                  based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating
                  both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings
                  reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at
                  least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of
                  LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least
                  50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about
                  the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The
                  projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income
                  jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities
                  and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not
                  restricted to industries with higher recent productivity
                  growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM,
                  about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed
                  significantly faster at the same level of quality. When
                  incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this
                  share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This
                  finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a
                  substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the
                  underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit
                  traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they
                  could have considerable economic, social, and policy
                  implications.},

                  hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated several
                  deficits in many aspects. However, no previous study employed
                  quantitative methodology providing objective measures that
                  could be compared among different studies with diverse
                  samples. To fill this gap, we used network analysis to
                  investigate how ADHD symptomatology impacts narrative
                  discourse, a complex linguistic task considered to be an
                  ecological measure of language. Fifty-eight adults (34 females
                  and 24 males) with a mean age of 26 years old and a mean of 17
                  years of educational level were administered the Adult
                  Self-Rating Scale for ADHD symptomatology. They also completed
                  the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression
                  Inventory and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance,
                  Sensation Seeking Behavior Scale. Intelligence quotient was
                  calculated. Individuals were asked to tell a story based on a
                  wordless picture book. Speech was recorded and transcribed as
                  an input to SpeechGraphs software. Parameters were total
                  number of words (TNW), number of loops of one node (L1),
                  repeated edges (RE), largest strongly connected component
                  (LSC) and average shortest path (ASP). Verbosity was
                  controlled. Statistical analysis was corrected for multiples
                  comparisons and partial correlations were performed for
                  confounding variables. After controlling for anxiety,
                  depression, IQ, and impulsiveness ADHD symptomatology was
                  positively correlated with L1 and negatively correlated with
                  LSC. TNW was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. In a
                  subdomain analysis, both inattention and
                  hyperactivity-impulsivity were negatively correlated with LSC.
                  Only hyperactivity-impulsivity positively correlated with TNW
                  and L1. Results indicated a correlation between ADHD symptoms
                  and lower connectedness in narrative discourse (as indicated
                  by higher L1 and lower LSC), as well as higher total number of
                  words (TNW). Our results suggest that the higher the number of
                  ADHD symptoms, the less connectivity among words, and a higher
                  number of words in narrative discourse.},

                  everyday activities. A type of spatial thinking that is of
                  particular significance to people's daily lives is cognitive
                  mapping, that is, the process of acquiring, representing, and

                  in humans and differs widely among individuals. Despite its
                  importance, however, the malleability of this skill through
                  practice has scarcely been studied empirically, in contrast to
                  psychometric spatial ability. Thus, this article examines the
                  possibility of improving the accuracy of configurational
                  understanding of the environment by training. A total of 40
                  adults with a poor sense of direction participated in the
                  experiment; and were randomly assigned to either a condition
                  in which they received feedback only or a condition in which
                  they additionally practiced allocentric spatial updating.
                  Participants walked one route in each session, once a week for
                  6 weeks, and conducted spatial tasks designed to assess their
                  knowledge of the route. A total of 20 people with an average
                  sense of direction also participated as a comparison group.
                  Results showed that training in allocentric spatial updating
                  improved the accuracy of direction estimates, although the
                  size of the effect was limited: the improvement was not large
                  enough to equate the performance in the groups with a poor
                  versus average sense of direction. The two groups, however,
                  did not differ in spatial skill in mental rotation or path
                  integration. Feedback was effective for improving accuracy in
                  straight-line distance estimates and sketch maps: repeated
                  trials with feedback led to improved accuracy by the sixth
                  session to a level comparable to the group with an average
                  sense of direction. The results show that flexible translation
                  between viewer-centered and environment-centered
                  representations is difficult and not readily trainable, and
                  provide insights into the nature of individual differences in
                  large-scale environmental cognition.},

  abstract     = {Governments worldwide are taking actions to address the
                  construction sector's sustainability concerns, including high
                  carbon emissions, health and safety risks, low productivity,
                  and increasing costs. Applying Industry 4.0 technologies to
                  construction (also referred to as Construction 4.0) could
                  address some of these concerns. However, current understanding
                  about this is quite limited, with previous work being largely
                  fragmented and limited both in terms of technologies as well
                  as their interrelationships with the triple bottom line of
                  sustainability perspectives. The focus of this article is
                  therefore on addressing these gaps by proposing a
                  comprehensive multi-dimensional Construction 4.0
                  sustainability framework that identifies and categorizes the
                  key Construction 4.0 technologies and their positive and
                  negative impacts on environmental, economic, and social
                  sustainability, and then establishing its
                  applicability/usefulness through an empirical,
                  multimethodology case study assessment of the UAE's
                  construction sector. The findings indicate Construction 4.0’s
                  positive impacts on environmental and economic sustainability
                  that far outweigh its negative effects, although these impacts
                  are comparable with regards to social sustainability. On
                  Construction 4.0 technologies itself, their application was
                  found to be nonuniform with greater application seen for
                  building information modeling and automation vis-à-vis others
                  such as cyber-physical systems and smart materials, with
                  significant growth expected in the future for blockchain- and
                  three-dimensional-printing-related technologies. The proposed
                  novel framework could enable the development of policy
                  interventions and support mechanisms to increase Construction
                  4.0 deployment while addressing its negative
                  sustainability-related impacts. The framework also has the
                  potential to be adapted and applied to other country and
                  sectoral contexts.},

                  identify, assess, and categorize the barriers to digital
                  transformation (DT) in the engineering and construction
                  sectors, and thus to better understand the impact and how
                  these sectors might be overcome.Design/methodology/approach
                  This study adopted a sequential mixed qualitative and
                  quantitative data collection and analysis approach. DT
                  barriers were first identified from relevant literature and
                  verified by an expert panel. Then, a questionnaire survey
                  assessing the impacts of the identified DT barriers was
                  distributed to construction professionals in China, and 192
                  valid responses were retrieved. Further, the data obtained
                  were analyzed using ranking analysis, exploratory factor
                  analysis (EFA), and partial least squares-structural equation
                  modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings Based on the ranking analysis, the
                  top three barriers are “lack of industry-specific standards
                  and laws,” “lack of clear vision, strategy and direction for
                  DT,” and “lack of support from top management for DT.” EFA
                  enabled the grouping of the 26 barriers into 3 categories: (1)
                  lack of laws and regulations (LLR), (2) lack of support and
                  leadership (LSL), and (3) lack of resources and professionals
                  (LRP). The PLS-SEM analysis revealed that LLR, LSL, and LRP
                  were found to have significant negative impacts on
                  DT.Originality/value These findings contribute to the body of
                  knowledge on DT in the construction industry and help
                  construction firms and government bodies improve the
                  understanding of these barriers to DT and put forward relevant
                  policies and incentives, thus seizing the DT benefits as a way
                  to enhance construction project management.},

                  tools to be used in the analysis of a changing social
                  situation. These tools should be used reflexively and should

                  science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and
                  verify theories that explain or predict human or
                  organizational behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to
                  extend the boundaries of human and organizational capabilities
                  by creating new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are
                  foundational to the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the
                  confluence of people, organizations, and technology. Our
                  objective is to describe the performance of design-science
                  research in Information Systems via a concise conceptual
                  framework and clear guidelines for understanding, executing,
                  and evaluating the research. In the design-science paradigm,
                  knowledge and understanding of a problem domain and its
                  solution are achieved in the building and application of the
                  designed artifact. Three recent exemplars in the research

  abstract  = {A trade union is an organized association of workers formed for
               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The
               article also notes the arguments suggesting that, in the presence
               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be
               shared between parties.},

                  considered to have at least four elements: contexts, theories,
                  actions and persons (who hold theories and perform actions in
                  specific contexts rather than acting in possible, abstracted,
                  universal or armchair worlds). The relationships of these

                  particular the complex nature of personhood is canvassed. It

                  Pedagogical praxis begins with the premise that under the
                  right conditions, computers and other information technologies
                  can make it easier for students to become active participants
                  in meaningful projects and practices in the life of their
                  community and suggests that professional practices such as
                  architecture, mediation, and journalism can provide
                  constructive models for helping students learn from such
                  experiences. In this vision, new technology reinvigorates
                  Dewey's (1915) idea of linking school with society. Technology
                  builds a bridge that allows young people to participate in the
                  learning practices of professionals; in the process, they
                  develop epistemological frameworks that organize the skills,
                  habits, and understandings they need to thrive in a complex,
                  postindustrial society. Although further work needs to be done
                  to explore the processes through which such learning can take
                  place, studies suggest that this perspective may be a

  abstract     = {OBJECTIVE: Grounded theory (GT) is an established qualitative
                  research method, but few papers have encapsulated the
                  benefits, limits, and basic tenets of doing GT research on
                  user and provider experiences of health care services. GT can
                  be used to guide the entire study method, or it can be applied
                  at the data analysis stage only. METHODS: We summarize key
                  components of GT and common GT procedures used by qualitative
                  researchers in health care research. We draw on our experience
                  of conducting a GT study on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                  patients' experiences of health care services. FINDINGS: We
                  discuss why some approaches in GT research may work better
                  than others, particularly when the focus of study is
                  hard-to-reach population groups. We highlight the flexibility
                  of procedures in GT to build theory about how people engage
                  with health care services. CONCLUSION: GT enables researchers
                  to capture and understand health care experiences. GT methods
                  are particularly valuable when the topic of interest has not
                  previously been studied. GT can be applied to bring structure
                  and rigor to the analysis of qualitative data.},

                  palette of digital tools available to further analyse complex
                  phenomena with interrelated data sets. However, few GT
                  researchers have systematically examined how the use of
                  diagramming tools can enhance analysis. To advance the

                  multi-representational approach that integrates with research
                  design. After diagrams supportive of GT are identified for
                  their potential improvements to the analytical process, the
                  research focuses on the experience of employing three
                  diagramming tools (Flourish, Observable, and Pajek) in
                  developing two complementary diagrams (Network and Arc

                  illustrated via a case study examining a century of innovation

  abstract     = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how
                  industrialized house building (IHB) could support productivity
                  developments for housebuilding on project and industry levels.
                  The take is that fragmentation of construction is one
                  explanation for the lack of productivity growth, and that IHB
                  could be an integrating method of overcoming horizontal and
                  vertical fragmentation. Design/methodology/approach
                  Singe-factor productivity measures are calculated based on
                  data reported by IHB companies and compared to official
                  produced and published research data. The survey covers the
                  years 2013–2020 for IHB companies building multi-storey houses
                  in timber. Generalization is sought through descriptive
                  statistics by contrasting the data samples to the used means
                  to control vertical and horizontal fragmentation formulated as
                  three theoretical propositions. Findings According to the
                  results, IHB in timber is on average more productive than
                  conventional housebuilding at the company level, project
                  level, in absolute and in growth terms over the eight-year
                  period. On the company level, the labour productivity was on
                  average 10\% higher for IHB compared to general construction
                  and positioned between general construction and general
                  manufacturing. On the project level, IHB displayed an average
                  cost productivity growth of 19\% for an employed
                  prefabrication degree of about 45\%. Originality/value
                  Empirical evidence is presented quantifying so far perceived
                  advantages of IHB. By providing analysis of actual cost and
                  project data derived from IHB companies, the article
                  quantifies previous research that IHB is not only about
                  prefabrication. The observed positive productivity growth in
                  relation to the employed prefabrication degree indicates that
                  off-site production is not a sufficient mean for reaching high
                  productivity and productivity growth. Instead, the
                  capabilities to integrate the operative logic of conventional
                  housebuilding together with logic of IHB platform development
                  and use is a probable explanation of the observed positive
                  productivity growth.},

  abstract   = {More than three-quarters of all new UK housing is currently
                delivered by the private sector using predominantly traditional,
                site-based, construction methods. Recently, the house-building
                industry has found itself under increasing pressure to raise
                production output to alleviate a shortage in housing supply and
                reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there has
                been much interest in the potential offered by off-site
                construction (OSC). The production strategies employed by
                private house-building firms however, are a direct response to
                their operational environment, and the adoption of OSC would
                arguably alter the way that they deliver their developments.
                Hence, there is a clear need to understand the relationship
                between production strategy and construction methods. Based on a
                case study of one of the largest private house-building firms in
                the UK, the potential impacts of OSC on current production
                strategies have been explored. The results indicate that the
                adoption of OSC approaches may alter the manner in which
                house-building firms are able to manage their production
                process, reducing their control and restricting the very
                flexibility on which their own success relies. The findings have
                implications for the housebuilding industry, OSC manufacturers
                and construction research, given the ongoing interest in OSC as
                a means to address the UK’s housing supply issues.},

                  In this paper, we argue that it offers an accessible and
                  theoretically flexible approach to analysing qualitative data.
                  We outline what thematic analysis is, locating it in relation
                  to other qualitative analytic methods that search for themes
                  or patterns, and in relation to different epistemological and
                  ontological positions. We then provide clear guidelines to
                  those wanting to start thematic analysis, or conduct it in a
                  more deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential
                  pitfalls in conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline
                  the disadvantages and advantages of thematic analysis. We
                  conclude by advocating thematic analysis as a useful and

                  reported on their findings, with less attention given to
                  methods. When methods were described, they followed the
                  principles of Yin; researchers paid less attention to the
                  equally important work of Stake. When Stake?s methods were
                  acknowledged, researchers frequently used them along with
                  Yin?s. Concurrent application of their methods did not take
                  into account differences in the philosophies of these two case
                  study researchers. Yin?s research is postpositivist whereas
                  Stake?s is constructivist. Thus, the philosophical assumptions

                  keeps agency and structure simultaneously in focus. However,
                  there are also problems in operationalising habitus, chiefly
                  because of the indeterminacy of the concept. In order to
                  overcome these difficulties I have outlined four key
                  components of habitus and attempted to delineate the aspects
                  of habitus as method that seem most relevant to primary
                  classrooms. Finally, drawing on ethnographic data gathered
                  over 15 months of participant observation in two primary
                  classrooms, the article seeks to explore through the lens of
                  habitus how differences of gender, 'race' and class are
                  produced by children in primary classrooms. Although I make no
                  claims for my own empirical work it does suggest that habitus
                  as method has the potential to reveal the taken-for-granted
                  inequalities embedded in everyday practices.]},

                  have occupied the academic literature for decades. Those
                  arguing in favor plead for greater rigor and clarity to
                  determine “what works.” Those arguing against protest that
                  education is a complex, social endeavor and that for
                  epistemological, theoretical and political reasons it is not
                  possible to state, with any useful degree of generalizable
                  certainty, “what works.” While academics argue, policy and
                  practice in Higher Education are beset with problems.
                  Ineffective methods such as “Learning Styles” persist.
                  Teaching quality and teacher performance are measured using
                  subjective and potentially biased feedback. University
                  educators have limited access to professional development,
                  particularly for practical teaching skills. There is a huge
                  volume of higher education research, but it is disconnected
                  from educational practice. Change is needed. We propose a
                  pragmatic model of Evidence-Based Higher Education, empowering
                  educators and others to make judgements about the application
                  of the most useful evidence, in a particular context,
                  including pragmatic considerations of cost and other
                  resources. Implications of the model include a need to
                  emphasize pragmatic approaches to research in higher
                  education, delivering results that are more obviously useful,
                  and a pragmatic focus on practical teaching skills for the
                  development of educators in Higher Education.},

                  development in MBA programmes relative to the needs and
                  desires of practitioners and students, and second, to present
                  findings and recommendations for increasing the effectiveness
                  of skill development in MBA programmes for the benefit of both
                  marketing practitioners and
                  academics.Design/methodology/approachThe research
                  design/methodology is based primarily on survey research on
                  skill development in MBA programmes from the perspectives of
                  both graduates and marketing practitioners.FindingsThis
                  research suggests that six important skill weaknesses –
                  decision making, leadership, problem formulation, persuasion,
                  creativity, and negotiation – need to be developed among
                  future marketers and that a marketing education framework
                  should be based on the pillars of a project and dissertation,
                  classroom debate and discussion, and oral
                  presentations.Research limitations/implicationsFuture research
                  should focus on understanding and explaining to an even
                  greater extent how marketing education can make more effective
                  use of interactive, hands‐on learning approaches typified by a
                  project and dissertation, classroom debates and discussions,
                  and oral presentations.Practical implicationsImplications for
                  practice include the suggestion that practitioners must also
                  assume responsibility for developing initiatives that
                  facilitate marketing skill development as
                  well.Originality/valueThe new and original value and
                  contribution of the research is that it extensively
                  characterises and quantifies the extent of a marketing skill
                  development gap – the gap between what marketing skills are
                  being developed in MBA programmes and what practitioners want
                  and need in marketers of the future in addition to providing

  abstract  = {One of the issues organizations face is identifying the required
               skills needed for a position and then evaluating whether their
               personnel have these skills or if there is a “skills gap”. The
               skills gap is the distance between the position requirements and
               the skills currently possessed by the worker in that position.
               While multiple models have been created over the years to address
               facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive
               framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker
               qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A
               composite skills gap model has been developed using the Design
               Science Research Method to combine elements of previous models
               and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of established
               criteria. The Skills Gap Analysis Model (SGAM) was evaluated
               using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a single
               taxonomy for both position requirements and the worker
               qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and
               comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model
               framework is adaptable to any domain, and that it is easy to use
               and not time consuming. The framework provided by the model
               establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses that
               allows for more analytical research in this area. By utilizing
               the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker
               qualifications, organizations can move personnel to better suited
               positions or utilize needed training in the specific areas
               identified. As technology moves towards increasing automation,
               robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of model can
               identify what skills are necessary for “re-tooling” the workforce
               to meet the needs to support these systems.},

                  This article explains the nature of taxonomic definitions,
                  with particular attention to their use in economics and other
                  social sciences. Taxonomic definitions demarcate one species
                  of entity from another. They are vital for the communication
                  of meaning between scientists, who must share some basic
                  conception of what types of entity they are investigating, to
                  establish a division of labour over subsequent theoretical
                  analysis and empirical investigation of the type of entity
                  defined. Generally, taxonomic definitions build on past usage
                  and are parsimonious: they are not meant to be explanations or
                  descriptions. By contrast, overloaded taxonomic definitions
                  can create square-one disagreement about what is being
                  investigated. As illustrative examples, the paper considers

  abstract     = {PurposePrime contractors spend up to 90 per cent of a
                  construction project's turnover on buying goods and services,
                  and thus suppliers have a large impact on project performance.
                  Therefore, the purchasing function management of the prime
                  contractor has a large influence on the overall performance:
                  the more developed (i.e. mature or professional) this function
                  is, the greater its positive contribution. The purpose of this
                  paper is to develop and test a quick scan purchasing maturity
                  tool by applying a design science research
                  method.Design/methodology/approachThe maturity tool is
                  developed by applying Hevner's framework for design science
                  research. In this framework, foundations drawn from the
                  available knowledge base are used to develop the new tool.
                  Scientific justification of this new tool and approval of its
                  approach for construction practice is obtained through testing
                  it in the specific context of a case company.FindingsThe tool
                  provides a company with insight into its current level of
                  purchasing maturity and possibilities for improving
                  performance by increasing this level.Originality/valueThe
                  conciseness and the limited time required to use the tool are
                  major advantages over existing alternatives for construction
                  practice.},

                  outlook on the labor market through the year 2020. The report
                  highlighted three talent shortages across the globe: nearly 40
                  million too few college educated workers in the global labor
                  market; a 45 million shortfall of workers with secondary and
                  vocational education in developing countries; and up to 95
                  million workers that lack the skills needed for employment in
                  advanced economies. This global crisis is known as the skills
                  gap. It impacts nearly every industry, job and employer.
                  Simply put, critical talent supply will fail to meet
                  employment demand in the coming decade. Such an imbalance can
                  be crippling to economic progress, put strain on governments,

                  frequently misunderstood. We outline the main variants of GT
                  and dispel the most common myths associated with GT. We argue
                  that the different variants of GT incorporate a core set of
                  shared procedures that can be put to work by any researcher or
                  team from their chosen ontological and epistemological
                  perspective. This “shared core” of the GT method is
                  articulated as the principles of (1) taking the word
                  “grounded” seriously, (2) capturing and explaining
                  context-related social processes, (3) pursuing theory through
                  engagement with data, and (4) pursuing theory through
                  theoretical sampling. In this article, we have put forward, in
                  a nutshell, a distillation of core principles underpinning
                  existing GT approaches that can aid further engagement with
                  the different variants of GT. We are motivated by the wish to
                  make GT more comprehensible and accessible, especially for

                  Charmaz. All three approaches use similar procedures, yet
                  there are important differences among them, which implies that
                  researchers need to make careful choices when using grounded
                  theory. Researchers new to grounded theory need to find the
                  most appropriate approach that fits their research field,
                  topic, and researcher position. In this article, we compare
                  the three grounded theory approaches. Choices of a grounded
                  theory approach will depend on the researcher's understanding
                  of the philosophical underpinnings of all three approaches.

                  especially education-related skills, have exploded in recent
                  years with a series of reports not only from
                  employer-associated organizations but also from independent
                  and even government sources making similar claims. These
                  complaints about skills are driving much of the debate around
                  labor force and education policy, yet they have not been
                  examined carefully. In this article, the author assesses the
                  range of these charges as well as other evidence about skills
                  in the labor force. Very little evidence is consistent with
                  the complaints about a skills shortage, and a wide range of
                  evidence suggests the complaints are not warranted. Indeed, a
                  reasonable conclusion is that overeducation remains the
                  persistent and even growing condition of the U.S. labor force
                  with respect to skills. The author considers three possible

  abstract     = {Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumptions,
                  beliefs, and judgments, and thinking carefully and critically
                  about how these influence the research process. The practice
                  of reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as
                  researchers and how this guides our research. It is central in
                  debates on objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations
                  of social science research and generated knowledge.
                  Incorporating reflexivity in the research process is
                  traditionally recognized as one of the most notable
                  differences between qualitative and quantitative
                  methodologies. Qualitative research centres and celebrates
                  participants’ lived experience, and qualitative researchers
                  are readily encouraged to consider how their own
                  positionalities inform the research process, forming an
                  important part of qualitative research training. Quantitative
                  methodologies in social and personality psychology, on the
                  other hand, have remained seemingly detached from this level
                  of reflexivity and general reflective practises. In this
                  commentary, we, three quantitative researchers who have
                  grappled with the compatibility of reflexivity with our
                  research, argue that reflexivity has much to offer
                  quantitative methodologists, in social and personality
                  psychology and beyond. The act of reflexivity prompts
                  researchers to acknowledge and centre their positionalities,
                  encourages a more thoughtful engagement with every step of the
                  research process, and thus, as we argue, contributes to the
                  ongoing reappraisal of openness and transparency in
                  psychology. In this paper, we make the case for integrating
                  reflexivity across all research approaches, before providing a
                  ‘beginner’s guide’ for quantitative researchers wishing to
                  engage reflexivity within their work, providing concrete
                  recommendations, worked examples, and reflexivity prompts.},

  abstract     = {The use of theory in science is an ongoing debate in the
                  production of knowledge. Related to qualitative research
                  methods, a variety of approaches have been set forth in the
                  literature using the terms conceptual framework, theoretical
                  framework, paradigm, and epistemology. While these approaches
                  are helpful in their own context, we summarize and distill
                  them in order to build upon the case that a balanced and
                  centered use of the theoretical framework can bolster the
                  qualitative approach. Our project builds on the arguments that
                  epistemology and methodological rigor are essential by adding
                  the notion that the influence of theory permeates almost every
                  aspect of the study—even if the author does not recognize this
                  influence. Compilers of methodological approaches have
                  referred to the use of theory as analogous to a coat closet in
                  which different items can be housed or a lens through which
                  the literature and data in the study are viewed. In this
                  article, we offer an evaluative quadrant for determining the
                  appropriate use of theory in qualitative research and a
                  diagram of the qualitative project that points to the central
                  role of a theoretical framework. We also caution against the
                  overreliance on theory in the event that it begins to limit
                  the ability to see emergent findings in the data.},

  abstract     = {This article serves as an introduction to the FQS special
                  issue "Participatory Qualitative Research." In recent years
                  there has been a resurgence of interest in participatory
                  research strategies. The articles in this special issue come
                  from different disciplines. Against the background of concrete
                  empirical research projects, they address numerous conceptual
                  considerations and methodological approaches. After reading
                  the contributions, and engaging with the authors' arguments,
                  we were prompted to focus in particular on those areas in
                  which further work needs to be done. They include, on the one
                  hand, fundamental principles of participatory research, such
                  as democratic-theory considerations, the concept of "safe
                  space," participation issues, and ethical questions. And, on
                  the other hand, we focus on practical research considerations
                  regarding the role and tasks of the various participants;
                  specific methodological approaches; and quality
                  criteria—understood here in the sense of arguments justifying
                  a participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a broad
                  discussion that does not focus only on participatory research
                  in the narrower sense. Because participatory methodology poses
                  certain knowledge- and research-related questions in a radical

                  language, social activity method (SAM), and illustrate some of
                  its applications. I shall introduce a new scheme for modes of
                  recontextualisation that enables the analysis of the ways in
                  which one activity – which might be school mathematics or
                  social research or any empirically observed regularity of
                  practice – recontextualises the practice of another and I
                  shall also present, deploy, and develop an existing scheme –
                  domains of action – in an analysis of school mathematics
                  examination papers and in the structuring of what I refer to
                  as the esoteric domain. This domain is here conceived as a
                  hybrid domain of, first, linguistic and extralinguistic
                  resources that are unambiguously mathematical in terms of both
                  expression and content and, second, pedagogic theory – often
                  tacit – that enables the mathematical gaze onto other
                  practices and so recontextualises them. A second and more
                  general theme that runs through the paper is the claim that
                  there is nothing that is beyond semiosis, that there is
                  nothing to which we have direct access, unmediated by
                  interpretation. This state of affairs has implications for
                  mathematics education. Specifically, insofar as an
                  individual’s mathematical semiotic system is under continuous
                  development – the curriculum never being graspable all at once
                  – understanding – as a stable semiotic moment – of any aspect
                  or object of mathematics is always localised to the individual
                  and is at best transient, and the sequencing of such moments
                  may well also be more individualised than consistent in some
                  correspondence with the sequencing of the curriculum. This
                  being the case, a concentration on understanding as a goal may
                  well serve to inhibit the pragmatic acquisition and deployment
                  of mathematical technologies, which should be the principal
                  aim of mathematics teaching and learning. The paper is
                  primarily concerned with mathematics education. SAM, however,
                  is a language that is available for recruiting and deploying
                  in potentially any context as I have attempted to illustrate
                  with some of the secondary illustrations in the text.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: According to Dweck and colleagues, praise can be
                  delivered using person ('you are clever') or process terms
                  ('you worked hard'). Research suggests that giving people
                  process praise after success can help them deal better with
                  subsequent failures because it attributes outcomes to effort
                  rather than fixed ability. However, research has thus far
                  inadequately addressed how these types of praise compare to
                  receiving no evaluative feedback. AIM: The aim of the present
                  research was to examine the effects of person and process
                  praise compared to a control group where only objective
                  outcome feedback was given. SAMPLES: In Study 1, 145 British
                  school children aged 9-11 years took part. In Study 2,
                  participants were 114 British university students. METHOD: In
                  both studies, participants read three scenarios and were asked
                  to imagine themselves as the main character. In each scenario,
                  they succeeded in an educational task and received either
                  person, process, or no praise. Participants then read two
                  scenarios, where they failed at a task. Following each
                  scenario participants evaluated their performance, affect, and
                  persistence. RESULTS: After one failure, participants who
                  received person praise reacted most negatively on all
                  dependent measures. However, those in the process condition
                  did not differ significantly from those in the control group.
                  CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that process feedback may
                  not be inherently positive; instead person feedback seems
                  particularly detrimental.},

                  current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
                  construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
                  Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
                  administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
                  about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
                  towards training. The survey intended to address the following
                  research questions, specifically in relation to the
                  construction industry. Findings – The survey results reveal
                  that whilst overall participation in workplace training is
                  high, the current workplace training environments do not
                  foster balanced skill development. The study reveals that in
                  the current absence of a formal and well-balanced training
                  mechanism, construction workers generally resort to their own
                  informal self-development initiatives to develop the needed
                  role-specific theoretical knowledge. Research
                  limitations/implications – The findings of the research are
                  based on the data primarily collected in the construction
                  industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are limited to a
                  single Tier 2 construction company. Practical implications –
                  The findings of this study can be utilised to suggest
                  improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
                  training initiatives. Social implications – The research
                  suggests that workplace training has positive relationship
                  with career growth. The results suggest that in the
                  construction industry, employees are generally well aware of
                  the importance of workplace training in their career
                  development and they largely appreciate training as being a
                  critical factor for developing their capacity to perform their
                  roles successfully, and to maintain their employability.
                  Originality/value – This paper is unique as it investigates
                  the current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within
                  the construction industry in Queensland, Australia. So far no
                  work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the main
                  method of workplace learning within the Tier 2 industry in the
                  context of Queensland Australia.},

                  to four year old children how to master a difficult
                  construction task. These strategies were derived from previous
                  studies of mother-child and experimenter-child interactions in
                  an assisted learning situation. One strategy the 'contingent
                  approach' was based primarily on theoretical considerations
                  and when used in earlier work as a basis for describing and

                  children taught by their mothers would do with a task after

                  mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our analysis of effective
                  instruction it is possible to predict how well children taught
                  by these four different techniques by a trained instructor
                  should perform after instruction.The present study largely
                  confirms these predictions. In so doing, it strengthens the
                  supposition that it was maternal behaviour in the earlier work
                  which influenced the children's task abilities and it also
                  corroborates various hypotheses about the essential nature of
                  effective face-to-face instruction.},

                  of a virtual reality driving simulator capable of conveying
                  haptic and visual messages to promote eco-sustainable driving
                  behavior. The driving simulator was implemented through the
                  Unity game engine; a large street environment, including
                  high-speed and urban sections, was created to examine
                  different driving behaviors. The hardware setup included a
                  gaming driving seat, equipped with a steering wheel and
                  pedals; the virtual scenarios were displayed through an Oculus
                  Rift headset to guarantee an immersive experience. Haptic
                  stimulation (i.e., vibrations) was delivered to the driver
                  through the accelerator pedal, while visual stimuli (i.e.,
                  icons and colors) were shown on a virtual head-up display. The
                  sensory feedbacks were presented both alone and in
                  combination, providing information about excessive
                  acceleration and speed. Four different virtual scenarios, each
                  one including a distracting element (i.e., navigator, rain,
                  call, and traffic), were also created. Ten participants tested
                  the simulator. Fuel consumption was evaluated by calculating a
                  mean power index (MPI) in reference to the sensory feedback
                  presentation; physiological reactions and responses to a
                  usability survey were also collected. The results revealed
                  that the haptic and visuo-haptic feedback were responsible for
                  an MPI reduction, respectively, for 14\% and 11\% compared
                  with a condition of no feedback presentation; while visual
                  feedback alone resulted in an MPI increase of 11\%. The
                  efficacy of haptic feedback was also accompanied by a more
                  relaxing physiological state of the users, compared with the
                  visual stimulation. The system’s usability was adequate,
                  although haptic stimuli were rated slightly more intrusive
                  than the visual ones. Overall, these preliminary results
                  highlight how promising the use of the haptic channel can be
                  in communicating and guiding the driver toward a more
                  eco-sustainable behavior.},

  abstract     = {Existing camera localisation methods for indoor augmented and
                  mixed reality (AR/MR) are almost exclusively image based. The
                  main issue with image-based methods is that they do not scale
                  well and, as a consequence, AR/MR applications are mostly
                  limited to small-scale room experiences. To tackle the
                  challenge of large-scale indoor AR/MR localisation, we propose
                  a novel framework for AR/MR localisation based solely on 3D–3D
                  model registration. The localisation is performed by an
                  automated registration of a low-density model of the
                  surroundings created by the device to the existing point cloud
                  of the environment based on learning-based keypoint detection
                  and description. Our solution takes advantage of recent
                  significant improvements in automated coarse-to-fine 3D–3D
                  model registration methods. Unlike the existing image-based
                  AR/MR localisation methods, which are restricted to small
                  room-sized environments, the proposed 3D registration-based
                  approach is applicable to large environments and is robust to
                  changes in colour and illumination of the scene. We perform
                  extensive testing and analysis of the approach with real-world
                  experiments and datasets using a prototype developed for the
                  Microsoft HoloLens. Experimental results show high
                  localisation reliability and accuracy, with a mean translation
                  error of 2.8 cm and a mean rotation error of 0.30°. The method
                  performs well in a large-scale environment (300 m2) and shows
                  good robustness to changes in scene geometry.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTDesign for manufacture and assembly (DfMA) has become
                  a buzzword amid the global resurgence of prefabrication and
                  construction industrialization. Some argued that DfMA is
                  hardly new, as there are concepts such as buildability, lean
                  construction, value management, and integrated project
                  delivery in place already. Others believe that DfMA is a new
                  direction to future construction. This paper aims to review
                  the development of DfMA in manufacturing and its status quo in
                  construction, and clarify its similarities and differences to
                  other concepts. A multi-step research method is adopted in
                  this study: First, an analytical framework is generated;
                  Secondly, a literature review is conducted on DfMA in general,
                  and DfMA-like concepts in the AEC industry; The third step is
                  to compare DfMA with related concepts. This study reveals that
                  DfMA as a philosophy is hardly new in construction, and the
                  empirical implementation of many DfMA guidelines has begun in
                  the AEC industry. The findings suggested that DfMA is a new
                  and mixed ?cocktail? of opportunities and challenges to
                  improve construction productivity with the advancement of
                  construction materials, production and assembly technologies,
                  and ever-strengthened logistics and supply chain management.
                  This study sheds light on three research directions: DfMA
                  implementation and guidance strategies, DfMA frameworks and
                  blueprints, and applications in cast in-situ or intermediate
                  prefabrication construction. Our research findings provide a
                  synopsis of DfMA research and development in construction.
                  This paper can also serve as a point of departure for future
                  theoretical and empirical explorations.},

                  market. However, despite the achievements made in the field of
                  VR, it is still an emerging technology that lacks deeper

                  investigate the applications of VR in industrial maintenance
                  to discover evidence of its values, limitations, and future
                  directions so that VR can be guided to better serve

                  is still not an indispensable element for the lifecycle

                  to exploit these technologies' innovative approaches and
                  capabilities. The study is specifically adopted to implement
                  small and medium-size architectural and construction practices
                  with a limited budget and time dedicated to visualisation
                  creation. The collected evidence proved that a game-like
                  platform combined with BIM could provide simplified data
                  delivery to a client, leading to customer satisfaction,
                  confidence and increased sales. The designed workflow and
                  templates were tested in the case study of a small self-build
                  construction company. The staff was trained to provide BIM
                  data correctly and use supplied game templates. The case study
                  demonstrated that automation of the VR House Configurator
                  creation is achievable. The study's outcome is an integrated
                  solution to regenerate BIM models in the game environment and
                  utilise the house configurator's organised furniture library
                  and costing interface. Furthermore, the usability tests
                  confirmed the applicability, practicability, and validity of
                  the developed framework and tools to deal with the revealed
                  challenges in the self-build sector. Finally, the research

                   improve the performance of construction project delivery.
                   While the construction industry is often labeled as
                   conservative and unimaginative with regard to technology
                   adoption, significant strides have been made in recent years
                    specifically, the use of Building Information Modeling
                   (BIM) for information storage, distribution and
                   communication, as well as Lean construction techniques such
                   as production planning and control (PPC). While the
                   implementation of these innovative technologies and practices
                   individually improve project performance, integrating them
                   together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is certainly
                   useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to the
                   paradox: how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a
                   2D space? Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology
                   that can help address this challenge. AR is both an
                   aggregator of information and an information publishing
                   platform which allows users a spectrum of capabilities to 1)
                   passively view displayed information, 2) actively engage and
                   interact with published content, and 3) collaborate with
                   others in real time from remote locations. No extant research
                   effort has comprehensively investigated the opportunities and
                   benefits of the integrated use of AR, BIM, and Lean in the
                   planning process to improve project performance. This paper
                   addresses precisely this research gap. Using insights gained
                   from real-world construction projects, this paper examines
                   the current state of production strategy process (PSP)
                   development  an integral part of PPC, identifies pain-points
                   and opportunities for process re-engineering using AR, and
                   develops an AR-enabled PSP future state.},

                  Using a Vygotskian framework it is claimed that in different

                  ontogeny through microgenetic development. This process of
                  ongoing problem?solving links social circumstances to the
                  development of cognitive structures necessary to conduct
                  vocational practice. It is held that such findings help
                  explain the limitations of transfer and also the need to
                  conceptualise expertise at the particular community of

                  cognitive tasks—tasks that require the processing of
                  information distributed across the internal mind and the
                  external environment. The basic principle of distributed
                  representations Is that the representational system of a
                  distributed cognitive task is a set of internal and external
                  representations, which together represent the abstract
                  structure of the task. The basic strategy of representational
                  analysis is to decompose the representation of a hierarchical
                  task into its component levels so that the representational
                  properties at each level can be independently examined. The
                  theoretical framework and the methodology are used to analyze
                  the hierarchical structure of the Tower of Hanoi problem.
                  Based on this analysis, four experiments are designed to
                  examine the representational properties of the Tower of Hanoi.

                 production system through a more structured workflow,
                 standardised products, and the use of robotics for automation.
                 However, there have been challenges in quantifying improvements
                 from the conventional method, which leads to the low uptake.
                 The concept of a digital twin (DT) is useful for OSM, which
                 enables production to be represented virtually and visually
                 including all activities associated with it, resources, and
                 workflow involved. Thus, essential information in the product
                 development process such as cost, time, waste, and
                 environmental impacts can be assessed. However, the data
                 required to have accurate results and better-informed
                 decision-making come from heterogeneous data formats (i.e.
                 spread-sheets and BIM models) and across different domains. The
                 inclusion of semantic web technologies such as Linked Data (LD)
                 and Web Ontology Language (OWL) models has proven to better
                 address these challenges especially in terms of
                 interoperability and unambiguous knowledge sys-tematisation.
                 Through an extensive systematic literature review followed up
                 by a case study, an ontology knowledge structure representing
                 the production workflow for OSM is developed. A real-life use
                 case of a semi-automated production line of wall panel
                 production is used to test and demonstrate the benefits of the
                 semantic digital twin in obtaining cost and time data of the
                 manufacturing for assessment. Results demonstrated the
                 potential capability and power of capturing knowledge for an
                 ontology to assess production workflow in terms of cost, time,
                 carbon footprint thereby enabling more informed decision making

  abstract     = {AbstractAmidst concerns over skills shortages, both the
                  current British government and its coalition predecessors
                  have, against the grain of wider austerity measures, invested
                  heavily in the apprenticeship system. The majority of
                  apprentices are, and have historically been, employed within
                  small businesses. However, research suggests that, in the
                  main, small firms tend to approach management issues ?
                  including workplace employee development ? in a less formal
                  way than their larger counterparts. What implications this has
                  for apprentices and their workplace learning remains unclear.
                  The article aims to address this gap, and it does so through a
                  qualitative study of apprentices in three English engineering
                  firms of different sizes. The findings broadly support the
                  established picture of informal working and learning processes
                  in the small firm. However, it is argued that this does not
                  inevitably restrict apprentices? on-the-job learning. Rather,
                  the ways in which apprentices learn, and what they learn, are
                  conditioned by the interaction ? or ?co-participation? ?
                  between the opportunities afforded by the workplace, and the
                  apprentice?s subjective agency.},

  abstract     = {ABSTRACTThis article explores change possibilities towards
                  status improvement in vocational education?s social
                  construction. Following other researchers, it assumes that
                  higher-status vocational education should give vocational
                  learners perspectives that would accord with their identities
                  and desires, broadly ranging between working in a particular
                  company and further studies. The article proposes that change
                  in this direction must concern the
                  transmitter-acquirer-knowledge-relation and also curriculum,
                  evaluation and the external relations of education. To think
                  systematically about changes of these ?adjusting screws?, this
                  article proposes a realist approach with Bernstein?s
                  conceptual language, and Moore's Bernstein-based model of
                  education where vocational learners, plausibly, receive an
                  orientation towards broad futures beyond narrow job roles.
                  Moore's model implies fundamental changes of all these
                  ?adjusting screws? and, importantly, of the principle
                  underlying their realisation in schools. The case of
                  company-based education in Germany?s ?dual system? is advanced
                  as a real-life example for the highly theoretical model.
                  Findings from a Bernsteinian analysis of the
                  transmitter-acquirer-relation in regulated company
                  transmission made sense, when the system was understood as
                  realising the principles envisioned in Moore?s model. The
                  model and its underlying principles, together with their
                  realisation in the DS, open up a perspective towards education
                  (instead of job training) in workplaces.},

  abstract     = {To meet the requirements of an increasingly innovative and
                  competitive environment, workers need to continuously develop
                  and maintain competence. Consequently, initial vocational
                  education and training should prepare (future) workers by
                  providing a basis for lifelong learning in developing both
                  routine and flexible competence. The question is whether
                  workplace learning in initial VET contributes to this aim. To
                  describe WPL processes and outcomes in the Dutch senior VET
                  context, we apply a further elaboration of a comprehensive
                  workplace learning theory, comprising a cognitive, a social
                  and an emotional dimension. Qualitative case studies show that
                  various factors in the different dimensions of learning
                  influence the learning processes and outcomes in a diverse
                  way. Especially more profound acquisition and development of
                  abstract principles relating to flexible competence does not
                  automatically take place during WPL. To fulfill the
                  expectations regarding the role of initial VET to contribute
                  to learning to learn and lifelong learning, improvements are
                  required.},

                  conflict, hostility and litigation between contractors are
                  commonplace. Such a climate actively militates against

                  We focus on employers? views on internships, which have
                  hitherto received only limited attention. Our study explores
                  employers? experiences in organizing internships, and their
                  collaboration with one University of Applied Sciences, through
                  data from social and health care employers (n=165), collected

                  that employers want to raise within the collaborative

                  is to explain how healthcare professionals (can) contribute to
                  the effectiveness of MDT, through the use of activity theory
                  (collective work activity shared by others who are motivated
                  by a purpose mediated by tools in order to achieve a specific
                  goal) and the associated idea of knotworking (method of tying,
                  untying, and retying together seemingly separate threads of
                  activity). The leading thesis here is that MDTs benefit from
                  health professionals with well-established leadership skills,
                  and also strong collaborative skills that enable them to
                  transition fluidly between leadership roles as needed to
                  advance patient care. Within activity theory, knotworking is
                  the process of tying and untying various threads of activity
                  and knowledge from across the MDT in order to accomplish
                  specific objectives over time. Knotworking exemplifies the
                  dynamic nature of MDT collaboration, which requires
                  professionals to be productive in their environment. The
                  viewpoints offered in this editorial contribute to a new
                  perspective on MDTs, one that acknowledges distributed

  abstract     = {PurposeApprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
                  trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
                  apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
                  fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
                  useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
                  workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However,
                  the completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in
                  the construction sector remain low in several countries across
                  the globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
                  published research on apprenticeship training that is
                  specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
                  the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
                  research.Design/methodology/approachA systematic review
                  approach was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using
                  SCOPUS databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified
                  and analysed.FindingsIt was found that monitoring and control
                  is the most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in
                  the completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast,
                  the length of time required for going through the full
                  training is the most common factor responsible for low
                  completion rates. Three research gaps were identified, among
                  which is the dearth of studies that has focused on apprentices
                  training in developing countries.Research
                  limitations/implicationsThe gaps identified in the current
                  knowledge on apprenticeship training would serve as a
                  justification for future investigations. However, the scope of
                  the review is limited to papers published in academic journals
                  and citable through SCOPUS.Practical implicationsThe outcomes
                  of the study provide researchers and other relevant
                  stakeholders with a concise report on the findings of previous
                  studies. It also provides insight into strategies for
                  improving the completion rates of apprenticeship training in
                  the construction sector.Originality/valueA systematic
                  evaluation of the extant literature draws on theoretical
                  evidence and highlights the factors that are more likely to

  abstract     = {CONTEXT: As a contribution to the State of the Science issue
                  on 'The problem with solutions', this paper discusses how
                  technology-mediated and assumedly simple and straightforward
                  solutions to professional problems in fact require extensive
                  work from professionals in order that generalised tools and
                  procedures can be made sense of, adapted and employed in local
                  practice. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE: The authors introduce a
                  perspective on epistemic practices in professional work and
                  learning in order to conceptualise and discuss the diversity
                  of the knowledge-related actions required to perform
                  professional services. They discuss how the growing numbers
                  and diversity of knowledge-generating actors who aspire to
                  inform professional practice create 'multi-charged' work
                  settings, imbued with multiple objectives and purposes. This
                  development presents new epistemic challenges to
                  professionals, which require extended capacities for knowledge
                  work. SUMMARY: The authors give examples from empirical
                  studies conducted in Nordic health care settings, which relate
                  to nurses' engagement with repositories of clinical procedures
                  and to the development of new medical technologies for
                  clinical use. They show how work performance in both cases
                  depends on a range of epistemic practices (ie, collective ways
                  of exploring, assessing, critically examining and justifying
                  knowledge claims), which are necessary if the general tools
                  and technologies are to be put to work in the local
                  environment. This forms a core dynamic in practitioners'
                  work-based learning as it moves between what is known and what
                  remains to be explored or improved. CONCLUSIONS: The paper
                  argues that the widespread belief in simple or versatile
                  solutions is challenged by research that reveals the diversity
                  of the knowledge practices needed to perform professional
                  services. The paper suggests that professional communities
                  might pay more attention to epistemic practices as means to
                  handle complexity. It raises intriguing questions and
                  discusses implications for medical education.},

               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and policies
               of vocational education and training (VET). With contributions
               from a panel of leading international scholars, the Handbook

               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning
               regions and skill ecosystems, and the professional development of
               vocational teachers and trainers. This important text: Offers an

                  organised, the organisational context, and learning in the
                  workplace. It develops, in part, from earlier work where we
                  argued that organisations differ in the way they create and
                  manage themselves as learning environments, with some
                  conceptualised as expansive in the sense that their employees
                  experience diverse forms of participation and, hence, are more
                  likely to foster learning at work (see Fuller and Unwin,
                  2004). The paper argues that contemporary workplaces give rise
                  to many different forms of learning, some of which is utilised
                  to the benefit of the organisation and employees (though not,
                  necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but much of which is
                  buried within everyday workplace activity. By studying the way
                  in which work is organised (including the organisation of
                  physical and virtual spaces), it is possible to expose some of
                  this learning activity as well as examples of the creation of
                  new (or refined) knowledge. Part of this process involves the
                  breaking down of conceptual hierarchies that presuppose that
                  learning is restricted to certain types of employee and/or
                  parts of an organisation. This paper builds on the work of
                  other researchers who highlight the importance of the context
                  (see, inter alia, Nonaka et al, 2005; Boreham and Morgan,
                  2004; Unwin et al 2005). It also draws on the work of
                  Engestrom (see, inter alia, 2001), who has highlighted the way
                  new knowledge is created through employee interaction when
                  problem solving and, hence, has paid attention to the
                  important question of the quality of learning in the
                  workplace. In addition, it builds on Wilkinsons (2002)
                  conceptualisation of the way organisations construct, manage
                  and respond to social relations of production that operate at
                  a variety of levels in productive systems. The paper uses
                  evidence from the learning as work project, which is based in
                  public and private sector organisations in the UK.},

                recently a project has been accomplished about developing,
                testing and researching VR-based learning about COPD for
                employees and students working in care homes. The empirical data
                includes interviews with seven learners. The results show that
                the learners are motivated for learning through VR, among other
                reasons, because they are active in the learning process.
                Furthermore, the results show that the learners achieve
                knowledge about a systematical treatment of COPD patients.
                However, they do not experience that they transfer this
                knowledge into altered ways of treating the patients. It is
                discussed why VR-based learning particularly underpins active
                participation and why the learners do not transfer knowledge
                into practice. It is concluded that VR-based learning should
                include systematic reflection.},

                method of enhancing robotic capabilities, it is important to
                consider effective ways to train these learning pipelines and to
                leverage human expertise. Working towards these goals, a
                master-apprentice model is presented and is evaluated during a
                grasping task for effectiveness and human perception. The
                apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with
                learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time
                and expertise while facilitating future scalability to
                supervision of multiple robots; the human provides
                demonstrations via virtual reality when the robot cannot
                complete the task autonomously. Experimental results indicate
                that the robot learns a grasping task with the apprenticeship
                model faster than with a solely self-supervised approach and
                with fewer human interventions than a solely demonstration-based
                approach; 100\% grasping success is obtained after 150 grasps
                with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary user studies evaluating
                workload, usability, and effectiveness of the system yield
                promising results for system scalability and deployability. They
                also suggest a tendency for users to overestimate the robot's
                skill and to generalize its capabilities, especially as learning
                improves.},

  abstract  = {Guest-edited by Owen Hopkins Multispace exists at the
               intersection of the physical and digital, and in the blurring of
               their previously clear dividing lines. Multispace is not a single
               space, but a hybrid space where, in effect, we occupy multiple
               spaces simultaneously. We enter it on a Zoom call, when we are in
               our office and in a meeting with 20 people; when we are cycling
               down a country lane whilst racing against thousands of others who
               also use the Strava app; when we are watching a TV show while
               live tweeting; or, perhaps most literally, when wandering around
               the local park looking for creatures that only appear on a
               smartphone screen. A fundamental question of this AD is why the
               phenomena that multispace describes are of concern to architects.
               The answer is that multispace points to a situation that is at
               root an architectural one. Offering both a collective and highly
               personalised experience, static and dynamically customisable, and
               above all at the same time public and private, multispace lies at
               the centre of a set of tensions, concerns and preoccupations at
               the core of our conception of architecture as theory and
               practice. It is the messy space between, with rough and uneven
               edges that are constantly shifting. Contributors: Aleksandra

                  robotic technologies in the architecture, engineering, and
                  construction (AEC) sector. Previous studies have focused on
                  domestic, service, and industrial robots, leaving the
                  construction domain unexplored. In this study, we set out to
                  empirically understand how various dimensions of technology,
                  environment, robot, and user lead to AEC stakeholders’
                  intention to use construction robots. We apply the fuzzy-set
                  qualitative comparative analysis approach to capture the
                  complexity of human behavior and the interdependencies across
                  dimensions. For the data collection, we sampled 216 cases in
                  Switzerland, Germany, and Austria evaluating three scenarios
                  of human–robot interaction. Our analysis identifies three
                  distinct user profiles—the lifelike robot user, the
                  utilitarian robot user, and the lifelike-utilitarian robot
                  user. The results show that human–robot peering may be a
                  fundamental solution to increase user acceptance. By testing
                  the effect of user characteristics, we also discover a
                  lifelike-utilitarian type of robot that is more appealing to
                  female AEC stakeholders. The study contributes to the

                  and implementation strategies. It points to future research

                  state of Industry 4.0 (IR 4.0) with regard to construction in
                  Australia and to identify the key factors that are driving and
                  hindering its adoption. A literature review and desktop review
                  were conducted to extract mainstream topics, followed by a
                  two-folded workshop designed with a multidisciplinary team of
                  academics, as well as representatives of mainstream firms and
                  peak bodies from the construction value chain. Our study has
                  highlighted the importance of considering both technological
                  and human-related factors in the adoption of IR 4.0 to address
                  barriers that have been traditionally overlooked, and work
                  towards a more successful and holistic implementation of this
                  transformative paradigm. By considering the social aspects of
                  construction, prioritizing data-driven approaches with a focus
                  on privacy and ethics, and emphasizing integration, these
                  facilitators contribute to the effective implementation and
                  success of IR 4.0 in the construction industry. The findings
                  of this study have significant implications for the
                  construction industry in Australia. Addressing the barriers to
                  digital construction adoption and embracing IR 4.0
                  technologies can help the industry to improve productivity,
                  reduce costs, and enhance sustainability. Additionally,

                  use of mass customization to increase product efficiency
                  without sacrificing design flexibility. Effective
                  implementation of mass customization can be done through a
                  product platform, i.e. a configurator. However, existing
                  configurators often lack integration of knowledge from the
                  downstream supply chain such as manufacturing. This paper
                  proposes a conceptual framework for a configurator unified
                  through a manufacturing kit-of-parts. Kit-of-parts are
                  pre-engineered and pre-designed digital models representing
                  fabrication-ready components. Using production rules and
                  restraints, accurate planning and design representations can
                  be derived and utilized in the configurator. This research
                  develops a configurator prototype using three-tier
                  architecture. The prototype supports a low-to-high level of
                  detail of kit-of-parts. It integrates product platforms and
                  project development across multiple building phases including
                  site planning, floor plan layout, and 3D model generation.
                  Finally, the implementation of a modular building configurator

                  Eligibility criteria for selecting studies Any randomised
                  trial with exercise arms for participants meeting clinical
                  cut-offs for major depression. Results 218 unique studies with
                  a total of 495 arms and 14 170 participants were included.
                  Compared with active controls (eg, usual care, placebo
                  tablet), moderate reductions in depression were found for
                  walking or jogging (n=1210, κ=51, Hedges’ g −0.62, 95\%
                  credible interval −0.80 to −0.45), yoga (n=1047, κ=33, g
                  −0.55, −0.73 to −0.36), strength training (n=643, κ=22, g
                  −0.49, −0.69 to −0.29), mixed aerobic exercises (n=1286, κ=51,
                  g −0.43, −0.61 to −0.24), and tai chi or qigong (n=343, κ=12,
                  g −0.42, −0.65 to −0.21). The effects of exercise were
                  proportional to the intensity prescribed. Strength training
                  and yoga appeared to be the most acceptable modalities.
                  Results appeared robust to publication bias, but only one
                  study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk of bias. As a
                  result, confidence in accordance with CINeMA was low for
                  walking or jogging and very low for other treatments.
                  Conclusions Exercise is an effective treatment for depression,
                  with walking or jogging, yoga, and strength training more
                  effective than other exercises, particularly when intense.
                  Yoga and strength training were well tolerated compared with
                  other treatments. Exercise appeared equally effective for
                  people with and without comorbidities and with different
                  baseline levels of depression. To mitigate expectancy effects,
                  future studies could aim to blind participants and staff.
                  These forms of exercise could be considered alongside
                  psychotherapy and antidepressants as core treatments for
                  depression. Systematic review registration PROSPERO

                  imposes restrictions on the flexibility of the product
                  offering when developing design standardisation. How design
                  process standardisation incorporates variations in products
                  has not been widely studied. The aim of this research is to
                  explain how design breakdown enables Lean Product Development
                  Flow (LPDF) and look-ahead planning in an industrialised
                  house-building context where an open platform is used. A case
                  study was conducted of how one of the leading industrialised
                  house-building companies in Sweden introduced the LPDF tool
                  Knowledge Innovation/Visual Planning (KI-VP) into their design
                  process. The implementation of KI-VP led to an increased
                  cross-functional understanding of relationships between
                  activities, which are an important factor in achieving
                  flexibility and a synchronised workflow. By using design
                  standardisation, look-ahead planning was implemented and used
                  in the management of design flow. Standardisation through
                  design breakdown provides a basis for knowledge innovation
                  that enables improvement of the open platform using a
                  bottom-up approach and increases the production flow.},

  abstract     = {Purpose This paper aims to evaluate the existing and emerging
                  Offsite Construction (OSC) skills. Construction industry is
                  inherently labour oriented, fashioning poor labour
                  productivity, low sustainability, slow and costly processes.
                  These shortcomings promote OSC alongside driving forces such
                  as industrialisation, automation and digitalisation. However,
                  the traditional construction skills are not on par with the
                  complexity, where robots, co-bots and digital-driven automated
                  systems create the need for novel OSC skills.
                  Design/methodology/approach Data collection is executed
                  through a Roundtable activity hosting Construction Management
                  academics form Australian universities specialising in
                  construction technology. They engaged in ranking of skills
                  along with creating a word cloud for the question, “what are
                  the future construction skills that will be more beneficial in
                  an OSC platform?” Word cloud is reviewed in a discussion
                  approach while skills ranking data is analysed using
                  descriptive statistics. Findings The most prominent OSC skills
                  are logistics manager, project manager and digital producer.
                  Attributes of skills that come under construction trades
                  workers, design, engineering and specialist professionals will
                  vary based on onsite-offsite percentage combination in a
                  construction project. Study reviews the required construction
                  skills at two ends of a continuum featuring the trade-based
                  skills; bricklayer, concreter and carpenter at one end
                  (traditional build) and the heavily digitalised and automated
                  skills at the other end (OSC). The noticeable transition
                  towards OSC urges industry practitioners, policy-makers and
                  education providers to focus on understanding and cultivating
                  key OSC skills. Originality/value This study describes the
                  transition of skills from onsite to OSC. It is presented as
                  one of the earliest attempts to evaluate OSC skill profiles.},

  abstract     = {Purpose The construction industry is currently responding to
                  pressures of industrialisation happening across all sectors.
                  Consequently, offsite construction (OSC) has become a vehicle
                  to achieve industrialisation. This requires changes in
                  traditional construction processes resulting in possible
                  changes in construction skill requirements. Accordingly, the
                  purpose of this study is to identify and review prevailing OSC
                  practices and skills in the Australian construction industry.
                  This study aims to critically analyse the existing skill
                  profile classifications through a single case study and
                  identify the need for an OSC specific skill classification.
                  Design/methodology/approach This study follows a case study
                  design, with an in-depth analysis of a single construction
                  project. Only one case study was studied because
                  scientifically, one example was enough to prove that the
                  prevailing skill classifications do not represent OSC skills
                  in a modern context. Data was retrospectively collected
                  through semi-structured interviews of project stakeholders
                  representing design, manufacture and assembly. Content
                  analysis was conducted to analyse the collected data and
                  produce findings. Findings This study identifies the
                  inadequacy of the existing classification system,
                  unavailability and the need of OSC specific skill
                  categorisation. It highlights new skills that enter OSC;
                  building information modelling engineer, three-dimensional
                  draftsperson, OSC project manager and project coordinator,
                  which are not identified in the available Australian skill
                  classifications. These, together with existing skills need to
                  be carved in to create a new skill classification.
                  Originality/value This study is the first of its kind where a
                  comprehensive OSC project is evaluated as a case study to
                  determine OSC skill classification requirements in Australia.},

                  automation and other types of technological changes on labor
                  demand, and use it to interpret changes in US employment over
                  the recent past. At the center of our framework is the
                  allocation of tasks to capital and labor—the task content of
                  production. Automation, which enables capital to replace labor
                  in tasks it was previously engaged in, shifts the task content
                  of production against labor because of a displacement effect.
                  As a result, automation always reduces the labor share in
                  value added and may reduce labor demand even as it raises
                  productivity. The effects of automation are counterbalanced by
                  the creation of new tasks in which labor has a comparative
                  advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the task
                  content of production in favor of labor because of a
                  reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and
                  labor demand. We show how the role of changes in the task
                  content of production—due to automation and new tasks—can be
                  inferred from industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition
                  suggests that the slower growth of employment over the last
                  three decades is accounted for by an acceleration in the
                  displacement effect, especially in manufacturing, a weaker
                  reinstatement effect, and slower growth of productivity than
                  in previous decades.},

  abstract  = {Apprenticeship is probably not the first approach to human
               resource development (HRD) that many contemporary managers and
               trainers would naturally refer to or even consider using as they
               seek ways in which to build workforce capacity. It can be
               dismissed as an anachronism in the light of the emergent
               discourse about the so-called knowledge economy and knowledge
               workers, as well as calls for greater occupational boundary
               crossing and multi-disciplinary/multi-skilled approaches to work.
               Knowledge workers are presumed to enter the workplace fully
               formed, armed with theoretical knowledge and (possibly) some work
               experience from their university degrees. In contrast,
               apprenticeship is positioned within an initial vocational
               education and training (IVET) paradigm and as a journey towards
               intermediate level expertise. Hence, for some, apprenticeship is
               an institutional arrangement between the state, employers and
               (sometimes) trades unions to train young people. For others,
               apprenticeship has echoes of a medieval world of individual
               craftsmen (sic), such as carpenters, goldsmiths and stonemasons
               who earned a living from their skills and formed guilds to
               control entry into their craft.},

                  in real-time and has the potential to enhance education,
                  however, few AR training systems provide personalised learning

                  the potential to improve training outcomes by providing
                  personalised learner support, such as feedback on the AR
                  environment. This paper reviews the current state of AR
                  training systems combined with ITSs and proposes a series of

  abstract    = {There have been many claims that Tangible User Interfaces
                 (TUIs) can positively impact learning. Alleged benefits include
                 increased usability, improved engagement and collaboration
                 among students, and enhanced perception of tasks, particularly
                 spatial ones. However, little empirical data exists to support
                 these claims. Moreover, despite their potential benefits for
                 learning, TUIs remain scarcely used in schools. This thesis
                 explores these issues within the specific context of vocational
                 education and training for carpenter apprentices. The learning
                 objectives focus on spatial skills, particularly the mapping
                 between 2D and 3D representations. We examine (1) whether TUIs
                 can support the training of spatial skills and, if so, what
                 features enable them to do so, and (2) what kinds of classroom
                 pedagogical scenarios TUIs can support. This research follows a
                 design-based approach and includes empirical studies, primarily
                 conducted in classroom settings.},

               voted the top Academic Book that Shaped Modern Britain by
               Academic Book Week (UK) in 2017, and in 2011 was placed on Time
               Magazine's top 100 non-fiction books written in English since
               1923. Reissued with a fresh Introduction by the Nobel-prize
               winner Paul Krugman and a new Afterword by Keynes’ biographer
               Robert Skidelsky, this important work is made available to a new
               generation. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
               transformed economics and changed the face of modern
               macroeconomics. Keynes’ argument is based on the idea that the
               level of employment is not determined by the price of labour, but
               by the spending of money. It gave way to an entirely new approach
               where employment, inflation and the market economy are concerned.
               Highly provocative at its time of publication, this book and
               Keynes’ theories continue to remain the subject of much support
               and praise, criticism and debate. Economists at any stage in
               their career will enjoy revisiting this treatise and observing
               the relevance of Keynes’ work in today’s contemporary climate.},

               and its contribution to worsening affordability over the past 40

               of financial regulation, property taxation, and housing policy
               have contributed to the ‘financialisation’ of housing, with its
               role as an investment good overriding the UK population’s housing
               needs. The UK has become locked into a “housing-finance feedback
               cycle” where increasing financial flows into housing generate
               rising prices, and expectations of future rises , which in turn
               generate more speculative demand for housing as an investment.
               This includes buy-to-let and second homes, with 1-in-5 homes in
               the UK now owned by landlords, and homeownership for younger

                 human well-being and provides a foundation for other rights,
                 including rights to health, education, water and sanitation,
                 freedom of association and freedom of expression, and the right
                 to life itself. It is one of the underlying key capabilities,
                 which Amartya Sen argues is required for opportunities to be
                 harnessed (Sen 1985). The United Nations has determined that
                 the right to adequate housing should not be interpreted
                 narrowly, such as being limited to having shelter or viewed
                 exclusively as a commodity, but rather it is to be understood
                 in a far broader sense: the right to live in peace, security
                 and dignity (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
                 Rights 1991). Realising this right in practice, however,
                 requires new thinking and new policies. The stark reality is
                 that we are a long way from achieving this goal. Our paper
                 suggests that to make this ambition real, we must bring a human
                 rights approach together with new economic thinking and
                 mission-oriented—outcomes-driven— economic policies. These
                 frameworks can reinforce one another. While the former invokes
                 legal accountability for ensuring adequate housing for all in
                 support of human flourishing, the latter organises and
                 accelerates the multi-stakeholder, whole-of-government action
                 required to meet this obligation. The United Nations
                 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving ‘access for all
                 to adequate, safe and affordable housing’ (SDG 11.1) can
                 provide a north star orientation for this new policy approach.
                 But achieving it requires unpicking the relationships between
                 current actors. It requires governments to set bold missions
                 that catalyse cross-sectoral investment and collaboration, to
                 embrace their role as market-shapers, to align public sector
                 tools, institutions and finance with these missions, and to
                 design partnerships – including with the private sector – that
                 prioritise human rights and the common good.},

               driving soaring stock prices. Yet measured productivity growth
               has declined by half over the past decade, and real income has
               stagnated since the late 1990s for most Americans. We describe
               four potential explanations for this clash of expectations and
               statistics: false hopes, mismeasurement, redistribution and
               implementation lags. While a case can be made for each

               contributor to the paradox. The most impressive capabilities of
               AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet

               adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills needed
               for successful AI can be modeled as a kind of intangible capital.
               Some of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected
               in the market value of firms. However, going forward, national

  abstract    = {This thesis describes the results of research aimed at
                 exploring the relationship between three different practices to
                 improve product development: Concurrent Engineering (CE), New
                 Product Development (NPD), and Project Management (PM). The
                 literature on each approach is abundant, yet studies explaining
                 their inter-relationship are scanty and contradictory.
                 Therefore, the main contribution of this thesis is explanation
                 and clarification of contradictory theories and perspectives.
                 In exploring this relationship four cases studies were
                 developed in companies that were applying these practices.
                 Principles of the grounded theory and qualitative research were
                 applied to gather and analyse data. The results suggest that
                 CE, NPD, and PM are relatively different in practice and
                 purpose and therefore they can be complementary to each other.
                 However, because of a lack of clearer definitions and
                 boundaries they are sometimes considered competing approaches,
                 as has been observed both in the literature and in practice.
                 CE, NPD, and PM were difficult to perceive as a sub-component
                 one of the other as has been suggested in the literature.
                 Rather, inter-linked process models seemed to better explain
                 how the inter-relationship was understood and applied. The data
                 gathered from the case studies suggest cause-effect
                 relationships that may guide practitioners to implement or
                 improve their product development practices. The investigation
                 explores the essence, purpose and the knowledge generation
                 process of CE, NPD and PM. It is suggested that NPD has a
                 higher level of maturity than CE and NPD. This suggestion and
                 the corresponding discussion is thought to be a contribution of
                 current philosophical debates on the subject areas thereby
                 nurturing the research agenda.},

                 (PMS) to monitor their performance, assess the success of
                 strategies, and/or assist the implementation of change
                 programmes for continuous improvement. Performance measurement
                 research has significantly evolved from developing conceptual
                 frameworks (e.g. balanced scorecard) to rethinking and
                 verifying the effects of PMS that is contextualised within the
                 organisation. Inspite of significant evolution, PMS remains
                 contentious conceptually and challenging for practitioners,
                 especially in construction where theory and practice face
                 contextual opportunities and constraints. While the approaches
                 of key performance indicators (KPIs) and project performance
                 benchmarks are predominating in construction research and
                 practice, a systematic investigation of the conceptual basis of
                 PMS is lacking in the construction context. This research
                 examines the challenges for PMS theory and practice.
                 Specifically, it aims to provide theoretical verification and
                 convincing evidence pertaining to the extent to which key
                 attributes of PMS lead to any positive effects in the
                 construction context. By conducting a mixed methods research
                 (i.e. a questionnaire survey and three case studies in UK
                 construction firms), this study finds: three attributes are
                 crucial for explicitly anatomising PMS – the nature, process
                 quality and the use; all of them can separately lead to
                 positive effects on sustaining project management and financial
                 performance of construction firms, whereas PMS process quality
                 plays a predominant role; both the nature of PMS and PMS
                 process quality are the prerequisites of the extant use of PMS,
                 which further improves system users’ perceived effectiveness of
                 PMS; and finally, both institutional and organisational
                 contexts largely shape and affect the adoption of PMS (the
                 nature and process quality in particular). This study primarily
                 contributes to systematically explicating the conceptual basis
                 and effectiveness of PMS in the construction context and
                 thereby uncovering the black box of how PMS affects
                 organisational performance in general.},

                 management research. However, in the field of construction
                 project management, it is relatively under-explored. This is
                 mainly due to the different organisational context of Temporary
                 Multi-Organisations (TMOs). This research re-explores the
                 notion of organisational culture in construction projects.
                 Based on Darwin’s theory of evolution this research goes back
                 to the very beginning; illustrating the exact meaning and
                 dynamics of organisational culture in a construction TMO’s
                 ecosystem. This research view an organisation and its forming
                 of culture(s) as part of an evolutionary process. Thus, a
                 critical realist’ view of causation is used as the foundation
                 of the research design and methodology. Case study materials
                 are provided from three Alliancing TMOs belonging to two major
                 infrastructure clients in the UK. A designer culture model and
                 the institutional theory are drawn upon to complement the basis
                 of analysis for evolution. A qualitative research method is
                 employed through semi-structured interviews and pre- and
                 post-interview meetings. Other supporting documentations are
                 also consulted. Three propositions and a postulate are
                 generated and examined against the empirical data. Findings
                 suggest that (i) the TMOs’ culture evolves through a set of
                 recursive stages across the project lifecycle, (ii) the culture
                 of the TMO undergoes several lifecycles during one lifespan of
                 the project, and (iii) there are some evidence that culture at
                 TMO level is learned, rationalised and routinised at corporate
                 level. The postulate shows that it is plausible to predict the
                 trajectory of how a TMO’s culture will evolve across the
                 project lifecycle given a set of organisational features. In
                 practice, findings suggest that hard artifacts alone are not
                 able to sustain established culture throughout the projec},

                 suggests corresponding reliance on psychological stimulus in
                 the decision making processes (Slovic et al, 2003). The
                 prevailing construction management research publications
                 however appear limited in exploring the psychology behind the
                 intuitive risk identification and treatment processes. The
                 purpose of this study therefore was to address the resulting
                 data gap by drawing upon theories from systems thinking and
                 behavioural science in examining the behavioural patterns of

                 propositions: risk perception categorisation within the
                 construction project delivery system reflecting the structure
                 of the differentiated specialist roles; psychological
                 difficulties associated with intuitive risk identification of
                 events outside the scope of our heuristics; incompatibilities
                 of mixing decision processing approaches and data presentation
                 formats from different systems of thinking and decision making.
                 The study has also made recommendations for future research
                 including, empirical investigations to test the sensitivity of
                 the other sources of affective heuristics including, personal;
                 project; organisational; and industrial experiences; in
                 influencing risk perception categorisation; empirical studies
                 to critically map out the heuristics boundaries of the
                 different specialist roles, and also to develop a model for
                 identifying the heuristics indicators for a construction
                 project to ensure compatibility in the affective
                 specialist-role stimulus of project team members and their

                 capabilities to mitigate failure could reduce significant

                 in addressing operational failure. By identifying and measuring
                 quality cost failure, owners and their supply network will
                 learn and be able to procure more integrated capabilities in
                 failure mitigation for reducing quality cost failure. This will
                 be achieved with better understanding of the relationship
                 between owner’s strategic requirement, technical project
                 delivery and functional operations management capabilities,
                 which is summarised in a capabilities cycle model. The model
                 illustrates the need for a strategic project and quality
                 management approach to integrate capabilities within each phase
                 of a project’s lifecycle. An integrated capabilities approach
                 is proposed for the owner and its multi-organisational supply
                 and operator network to integrate and collaborate in relation
                 to the capabilities required to equally share project risk and
                 quality cost in mitigating the failures.},

  abstract    = {Managing large infrastructure projects remains a thorny issue
                 in theory and practice. This is mainly due to their
                 increasingly interconnected, interdependent, multilateral,
                 nonlinear, unpredictable, uncontrollable, and rapidly changing
                 nature. This study is an attempt to demystify the key issues to
                 the management of large construction projects, arguing that
                 these projects are delivered through networks that evolve in
                 ways that we do not sufficiently understand as yet. The
                 theoretical framework of this study is grounded in Complexity
                 Theory; a theory resulted in a paradigm shift when it was first
                 introduced to project management post-2000 but is yet to be
                 unpacked in its full potential. The original contribution of
                 the study is predicated on perceiving large construction
                 projects as evolving complex systems that involves a high
                 degree of self‐organisation. This is a process that transitions
                 contractually static prescribed roles to dynamic network roles,
                 comprising individuals exchanging information. Furthermore, by
                 placing great emphasis upon informal communications, this study
                 demonstrates how self-organising networks can be married with
                 Complexity Theory. This approach has the potential to make
                 bedfellows around the concept of managing networks within a
                 context of managing projects; a concept that is not always
                 recognised, especially in project management. With the help of
                 social network analysis, two snapshots from Bank Station
                 Capacity Upgrade Project Network were analysed as a case study.
                 Findings suggest that relationships and hence network
                 structures in large construction projects exhibit small-world
                 topology, underlined by a high degree of sparseness and
                 clustering. These are distinct structural properties of
                 self-organising networks. Evidence challenges the theorisation
                 about self-organisation which largely assumes positive outcomes
                 and suggests that self-organising could open up opportunities
                 yet also create constraints. This helps to provide further
                 insights into complexity and the treatment of uncertainty in
                 large projects. The study concludes with detailed
                 recommendations for research and practice.},

                 the construction of hospitals is based on designs established
                 several years before the start on site. A retrospective
                 abductive, auto-ethnographic case study approach has been taken
                 in the examination of four major hospital projects over a

                 within a wider delivery model to understand the impacts of

                 temporal periods were observed, four of them relating to the

                 integration – where traditional procurement with Design, Bid,
                 Build delivery was combined with standards and guidance; (2)
                 dysfunctional integration – where the adoption of Private
                 Finance Initiative (PFI) with Design and Build delivery
                 transferred traditional roles and reduced standardisation; (3
                 and 4) adaptive integration 1 and 2 – which saw both a gradual
                 deregulation of standards; and, an understanding for standards,
                 and (5) the fifth temporal disintegration period – where
                 guidance from the wider delivery model ceased to be updated due
                 to top down policy reorganisation and lack of centralised
                 control and includes a current case study. Throughout these
                 temporal periods, it was found that the national delivery
                 models have had a significant influence on hospital project
                 delivery and particularly systems of systems integration. A new
                 model based on layering principles that shows the impact of
                 wider delivery models on systems integration is proposed to

  abstract    = {Built environment organisations innovate or adopt innovation to
                 address complexity and uncertainty that emerge in project
                 operations. Amongst various built environment innovations,
                 Building Information Modelling (BIM) is prominently chosen by
                 the built environment organisations. This innovation presents a
                 great challenge for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs).
                 It renders existing working paradigms obsolete and digitally
                 transforms built environment businesses. The lack of
                 individuals with adequate BIM competence is a major problem.
                 Project-Based Learning (PBL) is a potential solution. This
                 research aims to investigate BIM learning in projects in the
                 built environment SMEs. The study examines knowledge practices
                 used in projects and how they are exercised together in forming
                 a project-based learning mechanism of BIM. 31 designers and
                 engineers from the British and the Thai design and engineering
                 SME consultancies are interviewed. Knowledge practices are
                 identified based on their significance, while associations
                 between them are analysed. Informal meeting, Knowledge team
                 creation, and Standardisation play a crucial role in BIM
                 learning in projects. Informal meeting and Knowledge team
                 creation relate to tacit knowledge learning and exploration.
                 Standardisation encourages explicit knowledge learning and
                 exploitation. A project-based learning mechanism of BIM is
                 formed through an interconnected system of knowledge practices.
                 The connections among knowledge practices are found as
                 assistive and correlative. The project-based learning
                 mechanisms of BIM identified within this research are
                 ambidextrous through the variety of knowledge practices being
                 exercised together. Additionally, they can be further
                 categorised as Exploitative, Ambidextrous, and Explorative.
                 Practical suggestions are provided for BIM managers to increase
                 attention towards the employment of certain knowledge practices
                 and the creation of project-based learning mechanisms of BIM.
                 Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation
                 are recommended for managers of BIM and other innovations.
                 Innovation managers can balance ambidexterity by utilising an
                 array of knowledge practices to encourage both exploitation and
                 exploration. Proactive and tangible support such as the
                 implementation of guidelines and protocols from the public
                 sector in developing countries will promote BIM learning in
                 organisations and encourage industry-wide adoption.},

                 from daily activities to the appraisal of big infrastructure
                 projects. Building upon the underlying constructs of this
                 behaviour through the lenses of support and prospect theories,
                 operationalised in the internal and external view in the
                 project management context, helped me to formulate a conceptual
                 framework. This framework, called the “Holistic view” suggests
                 ways to integrate the two perspectives with the aim to improve
                 the quality of forecasts in infrastructure management.
                 Integration can be achieved by including subjective
                 probabilities and unpacking techniques into case-based
                 reasoning methods. Based on this framework and on the analysis
                 of the relevant policies, perspectives, definitions and
                 techniques provided by the literature on optimism bias in
                 project forecasting, I designed and administered four
                 experiments, with a sample of 231 participants. The results of
                 the first experiment show that there is a positive relationship
                 between different levels of dispositional optimism and resource
                 overruns. In the second experiment, I found that adding an
                 optimism uplift to an estimate structurally increases forecast
                 precision, however, this might lead to the use of more
                 resources than when optimism uplift is not applied. In the
                 third experiment, I found that unpacking, whilst making
                 estimations slightly more precise, does not influence the
                 estimations as in the previous case, but only the estimator.
                 The results of the fourth experiment, combining unpacking with
                 optimism uplift, indicated that forecast precision starkly
                 increased, supporting the adoption of an “Holistic view”. This
                 research shows the relevance of experimental methods in project
                 management, unveils new relationships between different
                 perspectives in the project forecasting field, and analyses,
                 net of other factors, the impact of forecasting tools
                 integrated in some of the policies addressing the effect of
                 optimism bias in estimations, suggesting ways to improve those
                 and the overall forecasting process of infrastructure projects.},

                 for Manufacture and Assembly (DfMA). Within the context of
                 China, there is a need for stronger implementation of digital
                 technologies and DfMA, as well as a knowledge gap regarding how
                 digital-enabled DfMA is implemented. More critically, an
                 integrated approach is needed in addition to DfMA guidelines
                 and digital-enabled approaches. For this research, a mixed
                 method was used. Questionnaires defined the context of
                 Huoshenshan Hospital, namely the healthcare construction in
                 China. Then, Huoshenshan Hospital provided a case study of the
                 first emergency hospital which addressed the uncertainty of
                 COVID-19. This extreme project, a 1,000-bed hospital built in
                 10 days, implemented DfMA in healthcare construction and
                 provides an opportunity to examine the use of modularity. A
                 workshop with a design institution provided basic facts and
                 insight into past practice and was followed by interviews with
                 18 designers, from various design disciplines, who were
                 involved in the project. Finally, multiple archival materials
                 were used as secondary data sources. It was found that
                 complexity hinders building systems integration, while
                 reinforcement relationships between multiple dimensions of
                 modularity (across organisation-process-product-supply chain
                 dimensions) are the underlying mechanism that allows for the
                 reduction of complexity and the integration of building
                 systems. Promoting integrated approaches to DfMA relies on
                 adjusting and coupling multi-dimensional modular reinforcement
                 relationships (namely, relationships of modular alignment,
                 modular complement, and modular incentive). Thus, the building
                 systems integrator can use these three approaches to increase
                 the success of digital-enabled DfMA.},

                 temporary in nature and traditionally structured around a life
                 cycle model consisting of predefined, time bound sequential
                 stages of work that are designed to process information and
                 reduce uncertainty. Yet as organising through projects becomes
                 both more prevalent and challenging, it could be argued that
                 such a model constrains our understanding and representation of
                 what ‘actually’ happens beyond these deterministic structures
                 and prescriptive routines, specifically in understanding ‘how’
                 construction project organisations transition through the
                 predefined time boundaries of the sequential stages. This
                 thesis contributes to this knowledge by identifying an
                 alternative image of the life cycle model through empirically
                 investigating the ‘transition’ between life cycle stages, with
                 ‘incomplete’ information. It identifies a five stage ‘recursive
                 process model of transitioning’ that highlights the underlying
                 generative mechanisms involved in the (re)creation of
                 organisational routines in managing the incompleteness
                 associated with transitioning from one life cycle stage to the
                 next. It presents an empirical autoethnographic case study over
                 one year, observing a construction project organisation as it
                 sought to transition from its design stage, through formal
                 sanction, and into its construction stage. Informed
                 ontologically by process metaphysics, and through challenging
                 the underlying theoretical temporal assumptions of temporary
                 organisations - ‘newness’, and organisational routines -
                 ‘repetition’, it describes managing project transitions as
                 ‘dialogical action’, influenced by the spatiotemporal aspects
                 of the organising inquiry. It identifies the patterning of
                 action within six transition routines, that when mapped over
                 time present the five stage recursive process model of
                 transition. Despite a successful three-year relationship in
                 developing organisational capability between the client and the
                 contractor in the design stage, as the pre-defined date for the
                 commencement of the construction stage neared, there emerged a
                 realisation of the impending uncertainty that this new stage
                 would bring. Triggered by various formal and informal
                 transition ‘rituals’, the organisations’ search for, and
                 assumptions about the ‘sufficient completeness’, or ‘necessary
                 incompleteness’ of information led to both the effortful and
                 emergent (re)creation in the ‘patterning of dialogic action’
                 from the design stage, into the construction stage.},

                 procurement and management (for example, Higgin and Jessop,
                 1965; Masterman, 1992; Franks, 1998 and Cleland and King,
                 1983), are identified. These limitations are associated with
                 the interdependence of roles, appropriateness of detail,
                 uniformity of presentation and the difficulty of quantification
                 in the context of a non-linear, complex, iterative,
                 interactive, non-hierarchical process that construction
                 comprises. Conceptually the research draws together Winch's
                 model of the construction project team as a temporary project
                 coalition (Winch, 1983:36) and Williamson's nexus of treaties
                 (in Aoki, 1992:1). The research proposes that current dramatic
                 changes in procurement and management strategies might be
                 observed and analysed if the construction project is
                 conceptualised as a network of relationships existing between
                 the firms that comprise the project coalition. These
                 relationships are contractual, those associated with
                 performance incentives and those associated with information
                 exchanges (the latter classified into the main functions that
                 the project team must perform - design development, cost and
                 progress management). It is proposed that social network
                 analysis (SNA) be used to investigate these networks. Following
                 a pilot study involving the BAA "Genesis" project, four case
                 studies were carried out. Two control studies involved
                 traditional procurement; a further two represented projects
                 utilising partnering, supply chain management and work
                 clusters, and involving two of the UK's largest and most
                 innovative clients. Analysis of the data focussed upon the use
                 of centrality (a measure of prominence within a network), as a
                 means of quantifying changing roles within the coalition and
                 the relationships between the firms providing these roles. The
                 research established that SNA is a very effective tool for
                 research into procurement and management. Findings suggest that
                 the changing prominence of existing roles and the evolution of
                 certain hybrid roles are readily quantified and graphically
                 represented using SNA; centrality is ideally suited to look
                 into the leverage that project actors exert within the
                 construction project supply chain; findings challenge some
                 existing views on the desirability and nature of fragmentation
                 within the UK construction industry; findings also suggest that
                 the two new procurement projects deal with the governance of
                 their respective coalitions in very different ways; a single,
                 prominent actor is needed to manage the supply chain;
                 traditional construction roles are changing rapidly - cost
                 management, design dislocation and the new role of cluster
                 leader are all important issues.},

                  and expertise sharing practices (KES) supported by augmented
                  reality (AR) systems. We draw on findings from a Design Case
                  Study (DCS) carried out for the design and evaluation of an AR
                  system to support KES in complex production contexts. Our
                  results suggest that the proposed system not only changes the
                  perception of the technical environment but is itself
                  gradually perceived as an element of it. The results also
                  reveal changes in the employees’ focus of attention when
                  working with the AR-aid in question and how they individually
                  adapt to it. Moreover, our findings suggest that the proposed
                  system facilitates a change in the proximity between experts
                  and non-experts, bridging spatial and temporal distances,
                  fostering cooperation between those two categories of workers,
                  at the same time that enhance their autonomy. Overall, the
                  results highlight how changes in the social environment of
                  digitised production cannot be separated from changes in the

                  labor productivity. The major finding is that businesses that
                  were operating below their expected labor productivity levels
                  in 1983 implemented new employee training programs after 1983
                  which resulted in significantly larger increases in labor
                  productivity growth between 1983 and 1986. This higher rate of
                  productivity growth was sufficient to bring these businesses
                  up to the labor productivity levels of comparable businesses
                  by 1986. The positive effects of training implementation on
                  productivity growth were shown to be inconsistent with a
                  "Hawthorne Effect" interpretation because the implementation

                  plant-level mechanisms through which IT could promote
                  productivity growth. We have assembled a data set on plants
                  with a common production technology in a narrowly defined
                  industry - valve manufacturing - to study the effects of new
                  IT on product innovation, production process improvements,
                  employee skills and work practices. The homogeneity of the
                  plants' production processes within this narrowly defined
                  industry together with the estimation of longitudinal models
                  eliminate many sources of unmeasured heterogeneity that could
                  confound productivity comparisons in more aggregate data and
                  in broader samples. The three main results of this study

                  manufacturers away from commodity production based on long
                  production runs to customized production in smaller batches;
                  (2)improves the efficiency of all stages of the production
                  process with reductions in setup times supporting the change
                  in business strategy and (3)increases the skill requirements

               off-the-shelf industrial artifact—and the development of the

               stems from its economic benefits and the degree of control
               afforded by factory manufacturing, but its aesthetic expression
               does not have to be compromised by cost alone. Prefabrication can
               combine traditional materials with contemporary aesthetics to
               create innovative solutions and still be affordable. It traces
               the ready-made from its inception in modernism to today’s
               kit-built and prefabricated houses.},

                  impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of AI
                  on the economy is one of society's most important questions.
                  In this work, we take a step toward that goal by analyzing the
                  work activities people do with AI, how successfully and
                  broadly those activities are done, and combine that with data
                  on what occupations do those activities. We analyze a dataset
                  of 200k anonymized and privacy-scrubbed conversations between
                  users and Microsoft Bing Copilot, a publicly available
                  generative AI system. We find the most common work activities
                  people seek AI assistance for involve gathering information
                  and writing, while the most common activities that AI itself
                  is performing are providing information and assistance,
                  writing, teaching, and advising. Combining these activity
                  classifications with measurements of task success and scope of
                  impact, we compute an AI applicability score for each
                  occupation. We find the highest AI applicability scores for
                  knowledge work occupation groups such as computer and
                  mathematical, and office and administrative support, as well
                  as occupations such as sales whose work activities involve
                  providing and communicating information. Additionally, we
                  characterize the types of work activities performed most
                  successfully, how wage and education correlate with AI
                  applicability, and how real-world usage compares to

  abstract     = {What does “transforming” construction mean? – Where is it, who
                  is doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
                  happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
                  elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars
                  on the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
                  transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so –
                  how? We set out with this Special Issue to answer these
                  questions and advance the theoretical understanding of the
                  transformation of the built environment, and how this requires
                  the construction industry to transform accordingly. We believe
                  that a “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
                  multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
                  industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
                  project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise
                  the process focus in contemporary social science through our
                  framing of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by
                  seeking out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice.
                  This resulting Special Issue will hopefully act as a
                  provocation for new perspectives on transforming construction:
                  it attempts to revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we
                  conceptualise both construction and construction research. The
                  eight papers build on a strong legacy of research on
                  innovation in construction management, while providing new
                  insights on what is being transformed and how; locating,
                  albeit tentatively, where the future debates are; and
                  identifying spaces where rich data may be found. Readers will
                  find a stimulating range of conceptual thinking and empirical
                  evidence being brought to bear on change, innovation, and
                  transformation, with extensive discussion of implications for
                  future research on construction policy, projects, and people,
                  broadening our field of view and drawing out strong new ideas
                  to guide practice. The structure of this Editorial is as
                  follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of key themes
                  within the transforming construction topic, as outlined in the
                  Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the content of the
                  eight accepted papers, positioning each paper under one of
                  three headings, which reflect the multi-scale perspective of
                  the Special Issue and as presented previously in the Call for
                  Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in which we set
                  out what we see as five major themes emerging from the papers,
                  characterising what transforming construction looks like from
                  the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
                  section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
                  pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
                  direction to future research in the area, followed by a short
                  commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.},

                  one-off products designed specifically for individual projects

                  flexible product platforms based on the theory of mass
                  customisation offer product flexibility with affordable costs.
                  The degree of commonality between products can also be
                  increased by applying the products-in-products concept. This
                  study aims to conceptualise and test theories of mass
                  customisation through modularisation for applications in the
                  construction industry. Three case studies on building and
                  infrastructure construction projects using different
                  specification processes (modify-to-order, configure-to-order

                  products-in-products concept is useful for enabling mass
                  customisation in construction. While select-variant
                  specification is compatible with relatively integral designs,
                  the architecture must have a modular structure to enable

  abstract    = {In 1966, the philosopher Michael Polanyi observed, "We can know
                 more than we can tell... The skill of a driver cannot be
                 replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar;
                 the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from the
                 knowledge of its physiology." Polanyi's observation largely
                 predates the computer era, but the paradox he identified--that
                 our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our
                 explicit understanding--foretells much of the history of
                 computerization over the past five decades. This paper offers a
                 conceptual and empirical overview of this evolution. I begin by
                 sketching the historical thinking about machine displacement of
                 human labor, and then consider the contemporary incarnation of
                 this displacement--labor market polarization, meaning the
                 simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and
                 low-education, low-wages jobs--a manifestation of Polanyi's
                 paradox. I discuss both the explanatory power of the
                 polarization phenomenon and some key puzzles that confront it.
                 I then reflect on how recent advances in artificial
                 intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the
                 likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.
                 A key observation of the paper is that journalists and expert
                 commentators overstate the extent of machine substitution for
                 human labor and ignore the strong complementarities. The
                 challenges to substituting machines for workers in tasks
                 requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity remain
                 immense. Contemporary computer science seeks to overcome
                 Polanyi's paradox by building machines that learn from human
                 examples, thus inferring the rules that we tacitly apply but do
                 not explicitly understand.},

                  graduate engineers seeking chartered status and trainee
                  chartered accountants. The first section introduces the
                  theoretical and methodological base provided by previous
                  projects, then proceeds to explore an epistemology of
                  practice, using three dimensions: (1) four key elements of
                  practice—situational assessment, decision‐making, actions and
                  meta‐cognitive monitoring; (2) the mode of cognition and its
                  dependence on time and prior learning; and (3) the context,
                  its influence on mode of cognition and its affordances for
                  learning. The central section presents the project’s findings

               the discipline, practice, and conduct of qualitative inquiry. As
               with earlier editions, the Sixth Edition is virtually a new
               volume, with 27 of the 34 chapters representing new topics or
               approaches not seen in the previous edition, including
               intersectionality; critical disability research; postcolonial and
               decolonized knowledge; diffraction and intra-action; social media
               methodologies; thematic analysis, collaborative inquiry from the

               co-production and the politics of impact; publishing qualitative
               research; and academic survival. Authors in the Sixth Edition
               engage with questions of ontology and epistemology, the politics
               of the research act, the changing landscape of higher education,
               and the role qualitative researchers play in contributing to a

               technological revolution that is radically redefining what work
               is, how value is created, and how the economy distributes that
               value. In particular, the authors observe that after the Great
               Recession of 2007–2008, many measures of economic health (such as
               GDP, corporate profits, and investment in equipment and software)
               rebounded quickly, while unemployment lagged behind, which they
               attribute to technology eliminating the need for many forms of
               human labor. Examples of technology they point to are robotics,
               numerically controlled machines, computerized inventory
               management software, speech recognition, speaker recognition,
               language translation, self-driving vehicles, pattern recognition
               and online commerce. The authors write that businesses are
               increasingly substituting machines for people, and that rate at
               which digital technologies are advancing is exponentially higher
               than that of the organizations, institutions, and individuals
               within our economy. Additionally, the corporate use of equipment
               and software is increasing faster than the rate of employment.},

  abstract     = {Fictional medical programs are often used for more than just
                  their recreational enjoyment; they can also influence career
                  decision making. Very little research has examined the
                  pedagogical value of fictional medical programs in terms of
                  their motivational value in the choice of a nursing career. As
                  such, the aim of this study was to examine what motivated
                  nursing students to choose nursing careers, if fictional
                  medical programs were motivators, and if they are used by
                  students as a learning tool. The cross-sectional study
                  collected data using a questionnaire and occurred between
                  April and June 2018. The findings were generated from
                  students' short answers and extended responses within the
                  questionnaire. Data were analysed using descriptive and
                  inferential statistics, while qualitative data were analysed
                  thematically. A total of 291 students participated (82.6\%
                  response rate), with motivations for entering nursing being
                  similar to other international studies; however, as
                  motivators, fictional medical television programs were rated
                  higher than job security. Overall, students engage with
                  medical television programs along a television-learning
                  continuum, ranging from limited watching time, recognising
                  inaccuracies, understanding dialogue, through to using
                  fictional medical television programs as tools for learning.
                  However, this is dependent on time, interest, current level of
                  understanding, and a program's perceived value.},

                  difficult to implement in scientific writing, where the ideas
                  can be complex and the structure less intuitive. In our

                  because those ideas are not yet scaffolded into a structure
                  that connects them.},

                  industrialized construction has significant comparative
                  advantages over traditional construction, primarily in four
                  indicators: (i) cost reduction, (ii) time reduction, (iii)
                  increased energy performance, and (iv) reduced environmental
                  impacts. However, there is no certainty about the range of
                  variation of these indicators for these comparative
                  advantages, creating uncertainty about the real impact of
                  industrialized construction. In this work, through a
                  systematic literature review based on PRISMA, 90 articles that
                  met the selection criteria related to the four mentioned
                  indicators were selected and analyzed. The results show that
                  industrialized construction has comparative advantages over
                  traditional construction but with a wide spectrum of variation
                  in each of the indicators. In the cost indicator, reductions
                  between 7\% and 50\% and increases between 26\% and 72\% are
                  observed; in time, reductions between 9\% and 50\% and
                  increases up to 32\% are recorded, and reductions in energy
                  demand between 20\% and 90\% are also reported. For the
                  environmental indicators, data were only provided for projects
                  in the design stage or for construction solutions on a scale,
                  demonstrating the need to obtain indicators in the operational
                  stage. It is concluded that although industrialized
                  construction offers significant advantages, it is essential
                  that new construction solutions consider contextual
                  variations, initial investment, logistical challenges, and
                  specialized labor to maximize their benefits.},

               contrasts it to ‘kompetenz’ in Germanic countries. It identifies
               six key problems with Competency-Based Training (CBT): first, CBT
               is tied to specific ensembles of workplace roles and
               requirements; second, the outcomes of learning are tied to
               descriptions of work as it currently exists; third, CBT does not
               provide adequate access to underpinning knowledge; fourth, CBT is
               based on the simplistic and behaviourist notion that processes of
               learning are identical with the skills that are to be learnt;
               fifth, the credibility of a qualification is based on trust, not
               what it says a person can do; and sixth, CBT is based on a notion
               of the human actor as the supervised worker. The article argues
               generic skills are not the alternative, and it uses a ‘modified’

               using surveys. The first measures the skills held by a given
               group of individuals -- the skills stock. The second focuses on
               the skills required to do the job competently -- job skills, and
               the third uncovers mismatches between skills supply and skills
               demand. In doing so, the chapter reviews the strengths and
               weaknesses of the survey tools and concepts which have been
               developed, and pieces together some of main findings which have
               emerged. The chapter therefore equips readers with the necessary
               tools to navigate their own way through the myriad of datasets
               available and the measures they use.},

  abstract  = {This chapter explores the relationship between unions and skills
               at the workplace. We argue that the significance of the skills
               agenda is broadly concomitant with a shift in the labour process
               beyond mass production into newer trajectories, variously
               described as post-Fordism, post-industrialism, flexible
               specialization and new production concepts. Unions are
               increasingly equating their members’ learning (and skills) as
               much as with enhancing their employability as with broader
               emancipation or entry into a trade. Through focusing on the
               contrasting cases of the UK and Sweden we show how the recent
               pursuit of the skills agenda has gone hand in hand with a
               strategic reorientation of unions, in response to more
               challenging bargaining environments and a declining membership
               base. We also argue that different approaches by unions to skills
               can be explained not only by national and sectoral factors but
               also by agency and voice mechanisms.},

               education, whereby the educator deposits information in the
               learners’ minds under the assumption that there is nothing to
               learn from the learners themselves. This model resonates with
               education under colonialism and neoliberalism, where some types
               of knowledge are deemed more valid than others. In Pedagogy of
               Hope, Freire invites us to overcome this model through hope, in a
               non-idealistic but ontological manner, acting in the world to
               transform oppressive conditions, expanding possibilities for

  abstract     = {The utilisation of theory, the conceptual framework, the
                  theoretical framework, and the research framework is
                  frequently required to be clearly articulated in academic
                  studies. However, these terms are often used interchangeably
                  without a clear understanding of their distinctions. This
                  scenario is complicated because the terms theoretical,
                  conceptual, and research frameworks are employed differently
                  in different research approaches. This article aims to define
                  these concepts and explain their usage with two research
                  approaches: the objectivist deductive approach, which goes
                  from theory to data, and the subjectivist inductive approach,
                  which goes from data to theory, together with a research
                  framework. The theoretical framework provides the foundation
                  of established theories and principles underpinning the study,
                  offering a broad lens through which the research phenomenon is
                  understood. The conceptual framework, derived from the
                  theoretical framework, refines the understanding by
                  delineating specific constructs and their interrelationships,
                  serving as a guide to address the research objectives.
                  Meanwhile, the research framework translates these constructs
                  into operationalised variables and methodologies, facilitating
                  the systematic collection and analysis of data. Together,
                  these frameworks ensure the study's alignment with established
                  knowledge while enabling methodological rigour and clarity in
                  addressing the research problem. Furthermore, the integration
                  of research, conceptual, and theoretical frameworks not only
                  guides the logical flow of a study and strengthens its
                  academic foundation but also enhances its potential to
                  generate meaningful insights across diverse domains, including
                  business innovation and strategy, international business and
                  marketing, technology and operations management, corporate
                  governance and ethics, human resource and project management,
                  and entrepreneurship.},
