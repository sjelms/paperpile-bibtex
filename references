              the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then

              students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher
              supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design
              of an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two
              aspects of this work have subsequently been used for further
              research. Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its
              associated theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that
              it could be implemented in software. This interpretation has
              informed further research about how one can model context and its
              impact on learning, which has produced a design framework that
              has been successfully applied across a range of educational
              settings. Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The
              software has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
              supported explorations into how to scaffold learners'
              metacognition, how to scaffold learners' motivation and the

               was programmed instruction in the late 1960s, followed by
               knowledge-based tutors that try to simulate good human tutors by

              for superimposing information onto the real world, has recently
              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies---localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices---which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and
              intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of
              AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access
              to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful,
              and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101
              research efforts, and outlines the research trends and

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating
              BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or
              her performance using MR. To address these topics, a
              quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of
              eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with
              building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and
              MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires
              to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results
              suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity
              rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to
              fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the
              number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the
              conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally,
              nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most
              still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design
              communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because
              many of the participants had substantial prior experience
              constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed
              the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size
              limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the
              contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a
              proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for
              communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not

  abstract = "Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
              have typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to
              enhance the process of information extraction from building
              information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
              workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated
              the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This
              research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness
              of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency
              through improving the information retrieval process during
              construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach
              was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a
              mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage
              capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop
              experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual
              information retrieval methods (control group), with information
              retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results
              revealed that the participants using the artefact were
              approximately 50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks,
              and committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
              This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing
              information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick
              Response markers can significantly improve the information

              they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
              protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
              Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed
              trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
              applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing
              complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive

              and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes,

              number of technical features and types that could be implemented
              in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and
              further elaborated, while significant application domains and

              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring
              systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or

              tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have
              answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the
              granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases.
              In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of
              answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and
              adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0

              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%

              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women
              and ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit
              markedly better performance for all groups on rates of attrition
              and completion. Joint programs have developed various
              innovations, including college credit for training and
              scholarship loans to expand apprenticeship and improve quality
              and retention, although there are no quantitative evaluations of
              the effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
              limitations/implications Statistical information includes about
              65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA. Practical
              implications The paper shows that alternative forms of training
              sponsorship have substantially different effects on enrolment and
              graduation. Identification of the practices, that improve
              enrolment and retention, and their widespread adoption would
              enhance the effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value
              The dataset used in this paper has not yet been used in any
              publications. The findings regarding joint programs are notable,
              in view of the skilled labor shortages facing the construction
              industry in the USA.",

  abstract = "Purpose New methods to introduce topics in classrooms are needed
              to enhance the construction management educational experience.
              One of these new methods is showing real time videos that
              highlight the various elements of concern in the classroom
              lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality
              technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to
              simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal
              constraints of various construction processes. The
              superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to
              virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This
              enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to
              visualize context and hidden processes otherwise unattainable
              through traditional classroom lectures.
              Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved perception
              of reality is created through the combination of the learners'
              ability to understand the complexity of construction products
              (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by viewing the
              real environment augmented with computer-generated information
              layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom with
              undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom
              learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they

               done 'for', 'with' or 'by' the users based on the assumption

               component in mass-market production and are seen as 'customers',

               the eGov+ project to discuss whether personas help designers
               engage with users. In this project, design was carried out in

               management and citizens from three different municipalities.

               HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more
               deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions
               where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly

               raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the

               include 4IR skills and knowledge. There is also no clear

               to embed 4IR, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and
               Internet of Things tools, skills and understanding into their

  abstract  = "Although computer-based simulations of workplaces are a
               promising way to prepare high school students for the world of
               work, it is unclear how many workplace simulations exist and how
               suitable they are for school-to-work programs. An extensive
               survey located 142 workplace simulations, many of which were not
               intended for the school-to-work market. Thirty-nine of the most
               promising simulations were obtained and analyzed to determine
               potential problems that might impede their use in school-to-work
               programs. These simulations were classified according to type
               (e.g., Skill simulations; Role-Playing simulations; and Strategy
               simulations) and then critiqued regarding common problems in
               using them (e.g., usability, learnability, content, and
               available teacher support). We indicate which problems are most
               common and what educators can do to overcome them. We close with
               a propositional analysis of two of the most promising workplace
               simulations that measures the job-specificity and implicitness
               of their content. We conclude that simulations can play an
               important role in school-to-work transition programs, even if
               not specifically designed for that purpose.",

  abstract  = "Mixed reality (MR) and mobile visualisation methods have been
               identified as important technologies that could reimagine
               spatial information delivery and enhance higher education
               practice. However, there is limited research on the impact of
               mobile MR (MMR) within construction education and improvement of
               the learners' experience. With new building information
               modelling (BIM) workflows being adopted within the architecture,
               engineering and construction industry, innovative MMR
               pedagogical delivery methods should be explored to enhance this
               information-rich spatial technology workflow. This paper
               outlines qualitative results derived through thematic analysis
               of learner reflections from two technology-enhanced lessons
               involving a lecture and a hands-on workshop focussed on MMR-BIM
               delivered within postgraduate construction education. Seventy
               participants across the two lessons recruited from an Australian
               university participated to answer the research question: `Does
               applied mobile mixed reality create an enhanced learning
               environment for students?' The results of the analysis suggest
               that using MMR-BIM can result in an enhanced learning
               environment that facilitates unique learning experiences,
               engagement and motivation. However, the study outcome suggests
               that to understand the processes leading to these learning
               aspects, further empirical research on the topic is required.

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and
               the opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and
               design. It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various
               technological trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon
               future urban, spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within
               architecture. The future is already here. Now is the time to

               forms of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest
               form is perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The
               great philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that
               the possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: ``A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.'' A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: ``he could [in any case] not be as strong as a
               mule.'' Moral perfection is the third, ``the highest degree of
               excellency in man's character.'' Of this perfection Maimonides
               says: ``Imagine a person being alone, and having no connection
               whatever with any other person; all his good moral principles
               are at rest, they are not required and give man no perfection
               whatever. These principles are only necessary and useful when
               man comes in contact with others.'' ``The fourth kind of
               perfection is the true perfection of man; the possession of the
               highest intellectual faculties . . . .'' In justification of his
               assertion, this extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges:
               ``Examine the first three kinds of perfection; you will find
               that if you possess them, they are not your property, but the
               property of others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is
               exclusively yours; no one else owns any part of it.''",

               on American highways and IBM's Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies---with hardware,
               software, and networks at their core---will in the near future
               diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply
               enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many
               tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age
               MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee---two thinkers at the
               forefront of their field---reveal the forces driving the
               reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of
               digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in
               the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced
               infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items
               that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching
               change. Professions of all kinds---from lawyers to truck
               drivers---will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to
               transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift:
               fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as
               productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and
               up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the
               best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity.
               These include revamping education so that it prepares people for
               the next economy instead of the last one, designing new
               collaborations that pair brute processing power with human
               ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically
               transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The

               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction
               industry. Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic
               mode and interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE
               device with Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the
               research gaps. Finally, an example experiment is provided to
               demonstrate studying hazard identification using eye tracking in
               construction safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from
               the participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan

              understandings of learning, development, and the goal(s) of
              development. In Vygotsky's usage, the term obuchenie, frequently
              translated as 'learning', more accurately indicates the
              interaction of teacher and student. Although the various domains
              (phylogenesis, sociocultural history, ontogenesis, and
              microgenesis) to which Vygotsky extended the concept of
              development have differing dynamics, the course of development
              within each domain is characterized by the transformative effects
              of cultural tools (mediational means) upon their users. Vygotsky
              posited a form of abstract rationality associated with
              decontextualization, a semiotic potential inherent in all human
              languages, as an ideal endpoint (telos) of development. Evidence
              that Vygotsky at times assumed the existence of another telos,
              corresponding to the semiotic potential of contextualization, has
              implications for a potential developmental account of

               module. Bayesian Networks are used to assess user's state of

               options and recommend future steps in the tutor. The proposed

               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal
               dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and
               cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In
               this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and
               diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal
               Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter
               may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the
               former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive
               behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant
               feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the
               application of the approach, we designed and developed several
               key components of an intelligent learning environment for
               teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic
               surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical
               interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard
               validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to
               produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.",
