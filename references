  abstract  = "Much current work on organizational knowledge, intellectual
               capital, knowledge-creating organizations, knowledge work, and
               the like rests on a single, traditional understanding of the
               nature of knowledge. We call this understanding the ?epistemology
               of possession,? since it treats knowledge as something people
               possess. Yet, this epistemology cannot account for the knowing
               found in individual and group practice. Knowing as action calls
               for an ?epistemology of practice.? Moreover, the epistemology of
               possession tends to privilege explicit over tacit knowledge, and
               knowledge possessed by individuals over that possessed by groups.
               Current work on organizations is limited by this privileging and
               by the scant attention given to knowing in its own right.
               Organizations are better understood if explicit, tacit,
               individual and group knowledge are treated as four distinct and
               coequal forms of knowledge (each doing work the others cannot),
               and if knowledge and knowing are seen as mutually enabling (not
               competing). We hold that knowledge is a tool of knowing, that
               knowing is an aspect of our interaction with the social and
               physical world, and that the interplay of knowledge and knowing
               can generate new knowledge and new ways of knowing. We believe
               this generative dance between knowledge and knowing is a powerful
               source of organizational innovation. Harnessing this innovation
               calls for organizational and technological infrastructures that
               support the interplay of knowledge and knowing. Ultimately, these
               concepts make possible a more robust framing of such
               epistemologically-centered concerns as core competencies, the
               management of intellectual capital, etc. We explore these views
               through three brief case studies drawn from recent research.",

                 susceptible to bias and result in incorrect decisions. This is
                 of particular concern when reviews address policy- and
                 practice-relevant questions. Systematic reviews have been
                 introduced as a more rigorous approach to synthesizing evidence
                 across studies; they rely on a suite of evidence-based methods
                 aimed at maximizing rigour and minimizing susceptibility to
                 bias. Despite the increasing popularity of systematic reviews
                 in the environmental field, evidence synthesis methods continue
                 to be poorly applied in practice, resulting in the publication
                 of syntheses that are highly susceptible to bias. Recognizing
                 the constraints that researchers can sometimes feel when
                 attempting to plan, conduct and publish rigorous and
                 comprehensive evidence syntheses, we aim here to identify major
                 pitfalls in the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews,
                 making use of recent examples from across the field. Adopting a
                 'critical friend' role in supporting would-be systematic
                 reviews and avoiding individual responses to police use of the
                 'systematic review' label, we go on to identify methodological
                 solutions to mitigate these pitfalls. We then highlight
                 existing support available to avoid these issues and call on
                 the entire community, including systematic review specialists,

                 or at least understand they are relevant to the knowledge work
                 commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from
                 the literature, however, is a solid foundation for the
                 philosophies underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit
                 knowledge informs the KM space. Research over decades shows
                 tacit knowledge underpins all other forms of knowledge,
                 enabling the interpretation and judicious application of
                 knowledge, leading (at its highest levels) to the concept of
                 wisdom. As an academic discipline, artificial intelligence (AI)

                 discipline for many decades, and is applied broadly in many

              not readily add tangible intrinsic value to the end-users. In
              large-scale construction projects, the process of monitoring the
              implementation of every single part of buildings and reflecting
              them on the BIM models can become highly labour intensive and
              error-prone, due to the vast amount of data produced in the form
              of schedules, reports and photo logs. In order to address the
              mentioned methodological and technical gap, this paper presents a
              framework and a proof of concept prototype for on-demand automated
              simulation of construction projects, integrating some cutting edge
              IT solutions, namely image processing, machine learning, BIM and
              Virtual Reality. This study utilised the Unity game engine to
              integrate data from the original BIM models and the as-built
              images, which were processed via various computer vision
              techniques. These methods include object recognition and semantic
              segmentation for identifying different structural elements through
              supervised training in order to superimpose the real world images
              on the as-planned model. The proposed framework leads to an
              automated update of the 3D virtual environment with states of the
              construction site. This framework empowers project managers and
              stockholders with an advanced decision-making tool, highlighting
              the inconsistencies in an effective manner. This paper contributes
              to body knowledge by providing a technical exemplar for the
              integration of ML and image processing approaches with immersive
              and interactive BIM interfaces, the algorithms and program codes

              subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two decades

              among the public, inadequate training measures, and an aging
              workforce. Reviewing the literature on the matter shows that the
              leading cause of shortage is low pay and increasing age of the
              workforce overall, while the demand for labor grows at a faster
              rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor worker retention

               is regarded as weak, with low skills levels considered to be a
               key contributory factor. Consequently, off-site construction has
               been identified by the UK Government as a vehicle for improving
               productivity levels if the skills deficiencies in this particular
               market segment can be addressed. A series of projects were,
               therefore, launched by the UK Commission for Employment and
               Skills (UKCES) to encourage an R\&D approach to skills and
               development application in the workplace. This paper reports on
               one of these research projects, a University and Industry
               collaboration between two of the largest off-site timber platform
               frame manufacturers in the UK. The paper explains how a needs
               analysis process was utilised to develop skills training content
               tailored to the immediate needs of the industry partners. It also
               explores how working with academia and a wider community of

               produced within factories, will be drastically affected in the
               future. In such a scenario, skills of the workforce affiliated

               the mismatch between the industry needs and the skills
               availability. Therefore, this research aims to identify the skill
               categories required for smart and modern construction in an
               offsite construction platform. An industry engagement workshop
               activity in the form of a roundtable discussion comprising of
               both academics and industry participants was carried out for data
               collection. There were total of six tables with the composition
               of four industry practitioners and two academics on each table.
               The academics were responsible for moderating the discussion. The
               views held by the participants are analysed using thematic
               content analysis method to compute the skills required for smart
               and modern construction. Ten themes were produced from the 60
               skills identified by the participants. Themes were developed to
               identify the recurring skills in a single cluster. Findings of
               the data analysis procedure indicate that knowledge,
               interpersonal skills and the ability to embrace digital
               technology are the key skill categories needed for future smart

                   synthesize a sequence of images from different poses. In
                   order to lift these outputs into a consistent 3D scene
                   representation, we combine monocular depth estimation with a
                   text-conditioned inpainting model. The core idea of our
                   approach is a tailored viewpoint selection such that the
                   content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured

                   strategy that iteratively fuses scene frames with the

  abstract  = "Open Building Manufacturing (ManuBuild) aims to promote the
               European construction industry beyond the state of the art.
               However, this requires the different stakeholders to be well
               informed of what ‘Open Building Manufacturing’ actually entails
               with respect to understanding the underlying concepts, benefits
               and risks. This is further challenged by the ‘traditional ways of
               learning’ which have been predominantly criticised for being
               entrenched in theories with little or no emphasis on practical
               issues. Experiential learning has long been suggested to overcome
               the problems associated with the traditional ways of learning. In
               this respect, it has the dual benefit of appealing to adult
               learner’s experience base, as well as increasing the likelihood
               of performance change through training. On-the-job-training (OJT)
               is usually sought to enable ‘experiential’ learning; and it is
               argued to be particularly effective in complex tasks, where a
               great deal of independence is granted to the task performer.
               However, OJT has been criticised for being expensive, limited,
               and devoid of the actual training context. Consequently, in order
               to address the problems encountered with OJT, virtual reality
               (VR) solutions have been proposed to provide a risk free
               environment for learning without the ‘do-or-die’ consequences
               often faced on real construction projects. Since ManuBuild aims
               to promote the EU construction industry beyond the state of the
               art; training and education therefore needs also to go beyond the
               state of the art in order to meet future industry needs and
               expectations. Hence, a VR interactive learning environment was
               suggested for Open Building Manufacturing training to allow
               experiential learning to take place in a risk free environment,
               and consequently overcome the problems associated with OJT. This
               chapter discusses the development, testing, and validation of
               this prototype.",

  abstract  = "Building on earlier publications by Harry Daniels, Vygotsky and
               Sociology provides readers with an overview of the implications
               for research of the theoretical work which acknowledges a debt to
               the writings of L.S. Vygotsky and sociologists whose work echoes
               his sociogenetic commitments, particularly Basil Bernstein. It
               provides a variety of views on the ways in which these two,
               conceptually linked, bodies of work can be brought together in
               theoretical frameworks which give new possibilities for empirical
               work. This book has two aims. First, to expand and enrich the
               Vygotskian theoretical framework; second, to illustrate the
               utility of such enhanced sociological imaginations and how they
               may be of value in researching learning in institutions and
               classrooms. It includes contributions from long-established
               writers in education, psychology and sociology, as well as
               relatively recent contributors to the theoretical debates and the
               body of research to which it has given rise, presenting their own
               arguments and justifications for forging links between particular
               theoretical traditions and, in some cases, applying new insights
               to obdurate empirical questions. Chapters include: Curriculum and
               pedagogy in the sociology of education; some lessons from
               comparing Durkheim and Vygotsky Dialectics, politics and
               contemporary cultural-historical research, exemplified through
               Marx and Vygotsky Sixth sense, second nature and other cultural

              systems are known as Intelligent Tutoring systems (ITSs). This
              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,
              Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.
              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
              intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
              enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction, evaluate
              learners, define and update the learner’s model, and classify or
              cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of the system,
              learner’s performance, and experiences were used for evaluation of
              ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user interfaces. Although
              these systems could facilitate reasoning in the learning process,
              these systems have rarely been applied in experimental courses
              including problem-solving, decision-making in physics, chemistry,
              and clinical fields. Due to the important role of a cell phone in
              facilitating personalized learning and given the low rate of using
              mobile-based ITSs, this study has recommended the development and

               faltering. Government at all levels has limped into the digital
               age, offering online services that can feel even more cumbersome
               than the paperwork that preceded them and widening the gap
               between the policy outcomes we intend and what we get. But it’s
               not more money or more tech we need. Government is hamstrung by a
               rigid, industrial-era culture, in which elites dictate policy
               from on high, disconnected from and too often disdainful of the

               approach taking hold that keeps pace with today’s world and
               reclaims government for the people it is supposed to serve.
               Jennifer Pahlka shows why we must stop trying to move the
               government we have today onto new technology and instead consider
               what it would mean to truly recode American government.",

               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an important
               moment for such a contribution because expertise is in transition
               - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational fields and
               continuous shaping of transformations. To understand and master
               this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are needed and are
               provided here. The theoretical framework which has shaped these
               studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT). CHAT
               analyses how people and organisations learn to do something new,
               and how both individuals and organisations change. The
               theoretical and methodological tools used have their origins in
               the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont’ev. In recent years this
               body of work has aroused significant interest across the social
               sciences, management and communication studies. Working as part
               of an integrated international team, the authors identify
               specific findings which are of direct interest to the academic
               community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning between
               operational and strategic levels within complex organizations;
               the refinement of notions of identity and subject position within
               CHAT; the introduction of the concept of ‘labour power’ into
               CHAT; the development of a method of analysing discourse which
               theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design of projects.
               Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful to
               practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who are
               interested in conceptual and empirical issues in all aspects of
               ‘activity-based’ research.",

  abstract  = "As policy makers increasingly focus on workplace learning as a
               way of improving organizational performance, the debate about the
               learning organization has grown. Counterbalancing the often
               over-optimistic assumptions made about the future of work and
               learning, this book argues that without a contextualized analysis
               of the field, our understanding of the learning environment is
               limited. It reconsiders the true role and nature of workplace
               learning in context. Grounded in original research, the book
               features case studies which illuminate how the workplace
               environment can provide both barriers to and opportunities for
               learning. It explores learning in different organizational
               contexts and different countries, sectors, types of public and
               private sector organization, and by different occupational
               groups. This multi-disciplinary approach provides a coherent
               perspective of the institutional, organizational and pedagogical
               contexts of workplace learning, and as a result, policy-makers,
               trainers, trade unionists and educators alike will welcome this
               groundbreaking text, as it gives the intellectual tools required

               skills’ programmes, both in the ‘needs assessment’ phase prior to
               the establishment of programmes and in the post-programmes
               ‘learning assessment’ phase. In the workplace, the unequal nature
               of the employment relationship and the requirement for programmes
               of education or training to have a measurable impact on
               profitability tend to conflict with the need for the
               dispassionate and unthreatening assessment required in programmes
               of fundamental education. This tendency has been magnified in the
               recent past as performance on literacy, numeracy and language
               proficiency assessments has been interpreted as a consummate
               indicator of ‘fitness’ for work. The chapter concludes that the
               use of ‘basic skills’ assessments represents an area of
               fundamental conflict between capital and labour and that, in
               cases where training programmes are designed to remediate basic
               skills ‘deficiencies’, the quality of the training itself is
               frequently as problematic as the assessment.",

               attainments of such learning. Drawing upon empirical data, we

               defines such learning in a narrow way, within an acquisition

               can be recognized. Ironically, the very types of learning likely

               gain a better understanding of workplace learning and to

                 practical sense training and development have become more of an
                 industrial relations concern, as policymakers exhort the social
                 actors to cooperate and build new partnership relations around
                 skills, training, and learning to help address the challenges
                 of building more productive economies. The chapter considers
                 the conceptual underpinnings of the industrial relations of
                 training, before reviewing developments in the British training
                 system, notably in terms of trade union?led learning

               a less miserable, more productive place.'' Every organization is

               incredibly useful, and leaders who attempt to improve workplace

               Robert I. Sutton and Huggy Rao teaches readers how to become

               unpacking how skilled friction fixers think and act like trustees
               of others' time. They provide friction forensics to help readers
               identify where to avert and repair bad organizational friction
               and where to maintain and inject good friction. Then their help
               pyramid shows how friction fixers do their work, from reframing
               friction troubles they can't fix right now, so they feel less

               addition sickness, broken connections, jargon monoxide, and fast

               prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one: since the

               urgency to the need to transform building construction in the

               in a computer-based virtual environment. No significant
               difference was found with regard to achieved skill level and
               skill consistency. A possible reason is that the complexity of
               the training task created a degree of intra-task interference in
               the blocked practice schedule comparable to the interference
               created by the mixed practice schedule. This result implies a
               need to further assay construction equipment operation to

               Derek Thompson puts pop culture under the lens of science to
               answer the question that every business, every producer, every
               person looking to promote themselves and their work has asked.
               Drawing on ancient history and modern headlines - from vampire
               lore and Brahms's Lullaby to Instagram - Thompson explores the
               economics and psychology of why certain things become
               extraordinarily popular. With incisive analysis and captivating
               storytelling, he reveals that, though blockbuster films, Internet
               memes and number-one songs seem to have come out of nowhere, hits
               actually have a story and operate by certain rules. People
               gravitate towards familiar surprises: products that are bold and
               innovative, yet instantly comprehensible. Whether he is
               uncovering the secrets of JFK and Barack Obama's speechwriters or
               analysing the unexpected reasons for the success of Fifty Shades
               of Grey, Thompson goes beyond the cultural phenomena that make
               the news by revealing the desires that make us all human. While
               technology might change, he shows, our innate preferences do not,
               and throughout history hits have held up a mirror to ourselves.
               From the dawn of Impressionist art to the future of Snapchat,
               from small-scale Etsy entrepreneurs to the origin of Star Wars,

              the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is trapped on
              two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf between the real and
              digital worlds prevents us from fully exploiting the volumes of
              information now available to us. Augmented reality, a set of
              technologies that superimposes digital data and images on physical
              objects and environments, is closing this gap. By putting
              information directly into the context in which we’ll apply it, AR
              increases our ability to absorb and act on it. AR will become the
              new interface between humans and machines, say Michael E. Porter
              of Harvard and James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of the industrial
              software maker PTC. Many people are familiar with AR entertainment
              applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR is being applied in
              far more consequential ways in business. Pioneering organizations
              are already implementing it in product development, manufacturing,
              logistics, marketing, service, and training—and are seeing major
              gains in quality and productivity. AR improves how users visualize
              information, receive and follow instructions, and interact with
              products. AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts
              the heat signature of a patient’s veins into an image superimposed
              on the skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR to
              show trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing—and has cut the
              time it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory workers
              have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using voice commands
              in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR will have a wide
              impact on how companies compete. This article walks readers
              through the questions firms need to ask when integrating it into
              their strategies and operations. The article also includes HBR’s
              first embedded AR experiences, which readers can launch by
              downloading a new HBR app on their mobile devices and then

               management and organization studies. While several scholars have
               reflected on this technique, comparatively few researchers have
               explicated the specific practices that constitute this method and
               discussed their implications for research on processes of
               organizing. The purpose of this article is to address these
               issues by offering a conceptual toolbox that defines shadowing in
               terms of a set of framing practices and provides in‐depth insight
               into the methodological choices and challenges that
               organizational shadowers may
               encounter.Design/methodology/approachIn this article, the authors
               explicate the specific framing practices in which researchers
               engage when taking an intersubjective approach to organizational
               shadowing. To demonstrate the value of viewing shadowing as
               framing, the paper grounds the theoretical discussion in actual
               fieldwork experiences, taken from three different ethnographic
               studies.FindingsBased on a systematic and critical analysis of
               fieldwork experiences, the paper argues that organizational
               shadowing is constituted by three interrelated framing practices:
               delineating the object of study; punctuating the process/flow of
               a given organizing process; and reflecting on the relationship
               between researcher and the object(s) or person(s) being observed.
               These analytical constructs highlight specific activities with
               which shadowers are confronted in the field, namely foregrounding
               and backgrounding particular aspects in defining a given object
               of study, trying to keep this object in focus as the fieldwork
               unfolds, and making decisions about the degree to which the
               relationship with shadowees should be taken into account in
               understanding this object.Originality/valueThis article provides
               an in‐depth reflection on the subtle practices that constitute
               organizational shadowing. It offers a useful conceptual toolbox
               for researchers who want to use this method and demonstrates its
               operational value to help them understand how knowledge
               construction is the outcome of a coconstructive process that
               depends on a series of decisions negotiated in ongoing

               understand economic and political polarization in the age of
               automation From the Industrial Revolution to the age of
               artificial intelligence, The Technology Trap takes a sweeping
               look at the history of technological progress and how it has
               radically shifted the distribution of economic and political
               power among society's members. As Carl Benedikt Frey shows, the
               Industrial Revolution created unprecedented wealth and prosperity
               over the long run, but the immediate consequences of
               mechanization were devastating for large swaths of the
               population. Middle-income jobs withered, wages stagnated, the
               labor share of income fell, profits surged, and economic
               inequality skyrocketed. These trends, Frey documents, broadly
               mirror those in our current age of automation, which began with
               the Computer Revolution. Just as the Industrial Revolution
               eventually brought about extraordinary benefits for society,
               artificial intelligence systems have the potential to do the
               same. But Frey argues that this depends on how the short term is
               managed. In the nineteenth century, workers violently expressed
               their concerns over machines taking their jobs. The Luddite
               uprisings joined a long wave of machinery riots that swept across
               Europe and China. Today's despairing middle class has not
               resorted to physical force, but their frustration has led to
               rising populism and the increasing fragmentation of society. As
               middle-class jobs continue to come under pressure, there's no
               assurance that positive attitudes to technology will persist. The
               Industrial Revolution was a defining moment in history, but few
               grasped its enormous consequences at the time. The Technology
               Trap demonstrates that in the midst of another technological
               revolution, the lessons of the past can help us to more
               effectively face the present.",

               diagnostic procedures, tests, and evaluations - the links between
               ADD and other conditions - how people with ADD can free up their

               parents and adults with ADHD a plan for minimizing the downside
               and maximizing the benefits of ADHD at any age. They offer an
               arsenal of new strategies and lifestyle hacks for thriving with
               ADHD, including: - Find the right kind of difficult. Use these
               behaviour assessments to discover the work, activity, or creative
               outlet best suited to an individual's unique strengths. -
               Reimagine environment. What specific elements to look for - at
               home, at school, or in the workplace - to enhance the creativity
               and entrepreneurial spirit inherent in the ADHD mind. - Embrace
               innate neurological tendencies. Take advantage of new findings
               about the brain's default mode network and cerebellum, which
               confer major benefits for people with ADHD. - Tap into the
               healing power of connection. Tips for establishing and
               maintaining positive connection, 'the other Vitamind C', and the
               best antidote to the negativity that plagues so many people with
               ADHD. - Consider medication. Gets the facts about the underlying
               chemistry, side effects, and proven benefits of all the
               pharmaceutical options. As inspiring as it is practical, ADHD 2.0
               will help you tap into the power of this mercurial condition and
               find the key that unlocks potential.",

               strategies that have helped her survive, even thrive, in a world
               not built for her brain. “The world of ADHD has been waiting for
               this book with bated breath for many years. If there’s a fairy

               harder.” When your brain works differently, you need to try
               different. Diagnosed with ADHD at age twelve, Jessica struggled
               with a brain that she didn’t understand. She lost things
               constantly, couldn’t finish projects, and felt like she was
               putting more effort in than everyone around her while falling
               further and further behind. At thirty-two years old—broke,
               divorced, and living with her mom—Jessica decided to look more
               deeply into her ADHD challenges. She reached out to experts,
               devoured articles, and shared her discoveries on YouTube. In How
               to ADHD, Jessica reveals the tools that have changed her life
               while offering an unflinching look at the realities of living
               with ADHD. The key to navigating a world not built for the
               neurodivergent brain, she discovered, isn’t to fix or fight
               against its natural tendencies but to understand and work with
               them. She explains how ADHD affects everyday life, covering
               executive function impairments, rejection sensitivity,
               difficulties with attention regulation, and more. You’ll also
               find ADHD-specific strategies for adapting your environment,
               routines, and systems, including: • Boost the signal and decrease
               the noise. Facilitate focus by putting your goals where you can
               see them and fighting distractions with distractions. • Have less
               stuff to manage. Learn why you have trouble planning and
               prioritizing, and why doing more starts with doing less. • Build
               your “time wisdom.” Work backward when you plan, and track how
               long it actually takes you to do something. • Learn about your
               emotions. Understand how naming your emotions and letting
               yourself experience them can make them easier to regulate. With
               quotes from Jessica’s online community, chapter summaries, and
               reading shortcuts designed for the neurodivergent reader, How to

               vocational education. It addresses a significant gap in the
               available literature by providing a single text that elaborates
               the scope and diversity of the sector, its key objectives (i.e.
               vocations and occupations), its formation and development as an
               education sector, and the scope of its purposes and
               considerations in the curriculum. The volume achieves these
               objectives by discussing and defining the concept of vocational
               education as being that form of education that seeks to advise
               individuals about, prepare them for, and further develop their
               capacities to perform the kinds of occupations that societies
               require and individuals need to participate in—and through which
               they often come to define themselves. In particular, it discusses
               the distinctions between occupations as a largely social fact and
               vocations as being a socially shaped outcome assented to by
               individuals. As people identify closely with the kinds of

               effectiveness of vocational education is central to individuals’

                 included throughout, including observations on research carried
                 out during the COVID-19 pandemic, to highlight how challenges
                 of conducting rapid ethnographies can be overcome. Case studies
                 across a range of subjects are also included, to demonstrate
                 how rapid ethnographies can be applied in practice. With its
                 useful tools and easy-to-read format, it will be used by

               sense of a family’s identity. We draw further on the results to
               differentiate between location as a technical aspect of awareness
               systems and what we characterize as “location-in-interaction”.

               workplace power. The authors examine how the social construction

               of power between capital and labour and how the new social
               construction of skills affects different types of workers by sex,
               class, and race, variously helping and hindering the employment
               prospects of these workers. It is argued that the social

               learning that are often dichotomized: formal and informal, theory
               and practice. Indeed one of the central challenges facing all
               those involved in developing understandings of workplace learning
               is that of conceptualizing how these aspects of learning actually
               come together within the experience of the learners. This chapter
               outlines key aspects of our research into the accountancy
               profession which aims, amongst other things, to assist in the
               re-engineering of the learning experience within accountancy,
               into something more ‘integrative’. We believe a focus on context,
               power and perspective, within an understanding of the
               ‘disciplinary ways of being’ at the heart of modern learning, is
               fundamental to understandings of learning and also to the process
               of change management within education and training. We offer an
               analysis of our template for change within education and training
               in the accountancy profession framed within a discussion of those
               aspects of context, power and perspective salient in this case.",

               myth-busting guide to AI past and present, one of the world's
               leading researchers shows why our fears for the future are
               misplaced.The ultimate dream of AI is to build machines that are
               like us: conscious and self-aware. While this remains a remote
               possibility, rapid progress in AI is already transforming our
               world. Yet the public debate is still largely centred on unlikely
               prospects, from sentient machines to dystopian robot takeovers.In
               this lively and clear-headed guide, Michael Wooldridge challenges
               the prevailing narrative, revealing how the hype distracts us
               from both the more immediate risks that this technology poses -
               from algorithmic bias to fake news - and the true life-changing

               research as a systematic process, describes how to formulate
               research questions, provides an in-depth explanation of different
               research methods (qualitative, quantitative, and experimental),
               and explains how to select appropriate research methods and
               execute research studies. It describes the process of
               documentation, knowledge dissemination, and application of
               research results in architectural design and practice. Most
               importantly, it provides guidelines for integrating research into
               profession and uses extensive case-studies and practice-relevant
               examples to illustrate main concepts, procedures, and
               applications. Integrating research into practice is essential for
               developing new knowledge, solving design and technical problems,
               overcoming different types of challenges present in the
               contemporary profession, and improving the design outcomes.
               Innovation requires a much stronger correlation between research
               and design, and it is pertinent for the future of architectural
               practice that research becomes an integral part of architectural
               profession. This book provides a roadmap for successfully
               integrating research into architectural design and for
               establishing innovative practices, regardless of a firm’s size.
               Written by an architecture professor with an extensive research
               and professional background—specifically focusing on integrating

  abstract  = "The three concepts central to this volume—practice, learning and
               change—have received very different treatments in the educational
               literature, an oversight directly confronted here. While learning
               and change have been extensively theorised, their various
               contexts articulated and analysed, practice is notably
               underrepresented. Where much of the literature on learning and
               change takes the notion of ‘practice’ as an unexamined given, its
               co-location as a term with various classifiers, as in ‘legal
               practice’ and ‘teaching practice’, render it curiously devoid of
               semantic force.In this book, ‘practice’ is the super-ordinate
               organising idea. Drawing on what has been termed the ‘practice
               turn in contemporary theory’, the work develops a conceptual
               framework for researching learning in, and on, practice. It
               challenges received notions of practice, questioning the
               assumptions, elisions, conflations and silences on the subject.
               In so doing, it offers fresh insights into learning and change,
               and how they relate to practice. In tandem with this conceptual
               work, the book details site-ontological studies of practice and
               learning in diverse professional and workplace contexts,
               examining the work of occupations as various as doctors, chefs
               and orchestral musicians. It demonstrates the value of theorising

  abstract  = "This book centres on a broadened view of complexity that will
               enrich engagement with complexity in the social sciences. The key
               idea is to employ complexity theory to develop a holistic account
               of practice, agency and expertise. In doing so, the book
               acknowledges and builds upon the relational character of
               reductive accounts. It draws upon recent theoretical work on
               complexity, emergence and relationality to develop a novel
               account of practice, agency and expertise in and for workplaces.
               Biological, psychological and social aspects of these are
               integrated. This novel account overcomes problems in current
               views of practice, agency and expertise, which suffer from
               reductive, or fragmented, analyses, based upon individuals,
               groups, or networks. In retrieving the experiential richness of
               human activity – often esteemed as the basis of generative and
               creative life – this book shows how complexity both emerges from,
               and is, a non-reductive feature of, human experience, especially
               in daily work.“...an ambitiously wide-ranging volume, questioning

               argument that: ‘whatever reductive moves are made, they ‘flow’
               from holistic accounts of relationality which have already
               affectively engaged the purposes of a co-present group.’ This is
               the intellectual contribution that is built consistently and
               persuasively across the chapters.” Professor Emerita Anne
               Edwards, Oxford University``Hager and Beckett have written a book
               that will challenge more commonly held notions of agency,
               practice, skills, and learning. Centering their argument on
               complexity theory or, as they prefer, complexity thinking, Hager
               and Beckett argue that it is through relations that we raise
               questions about, gather data from, and make working sense of the
               complexity that surrounds us. Groups then, particularly small
               groups, hold and implement agentive power. And what the authors
               call co-present groups—ones in which holistic relationality
               occurs socially, and affectively in distinctive places—“draw us
               closer to each other, and harness our normativity by enabling
               negotiability and reason-giving.” If your field of study involves
               anything remotely sociocultural in nature or if you are just
               interested in the complex ways we engage as humans with our
               worlds, you should find a place for this book in your

  abstract  = "The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been
               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat
               ironically, his theory of development has never been well
               understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much of
               this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding
               Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of
               Vygotsky’s important essays, most of which have previously been
               unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages
               can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In
               these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of
               cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in
               American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be
               understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the
               only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well
               as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a
               simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language,
               society provides the individual with technology that can be used
               to shape the private processes of mind. In Mind in Society
               Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of
               perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he
               examines its implications for education. The result is a
               remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky’s
               relevance to modern psychological thought.",

               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces – ranging from offices, factories and shops to gyms,
               health centres and universities – and how it can be improved.
               Such learning includes everyday work activity, on-the-job
               instruction and off-the-job training events. Improving Working as
               Learning is the first book to analyze systematically learning at
               work in different settings by developing and applying a new
               analytical framework. The Working as Learning Framework connects
               the particularities of work tasks with the way jobs are organized
               and the wider pressures and constraints organizations face for
               survival, growth and development. The authors convincingly
               demonstrate that the framework offers a sophisticated
               understanding of how improving the work environment – both within
               the workplace and beyond – can enhance and sustain improvements
               in learning at work. This topical book will appeal to an

                 is a course of learning across different school- and work-based
                 practices. This chapter discusses such learning in terms of
                 boundary crossing between these practices. We conceptualize
                 boundaries as sociocultural differences that lead to
                 discontinuity in action or interaction. Such discontinuities
                 between school and work practices have frequently been reported
                 as problematic. Boundary crossing is defined as the efforts by
                 individuals or groups to establish or restore continuity in
                 relation to action or interaction across practices. As this
                 chapter argues, these efforts point to the learning potential
                 of boundary crossing between school and work practices, which
                 we summarize in terms of four learning mechanisms:
                 identification, coordination, perspective making and taking (or
                 mutual reflection), and transformation. These learning
                 mechanisms are discussed through illustrations from vocational
                 education and training. The chapter concludes by speculating on
                 what would be fruitful boundary analyses of situations where a

               and leaders face big questions every day: What's the most
               important place to focus your effort, and how do you start? What
               will your idea look like in real life? How many meetings and
               discussions does it take before you can be sure you have the
               right solution?Now there's a sure-fire way to answer these
               important questions: the sprint. Designer Jake Knapp created the
               five-day process at Google, where sprints were used on everything
               from Google Search to Google X. He joined Braden Kowitz and John
               Zeratsky at Google Ventures, and together they have completed
               more than one hundred sprints with companies in mobile,
               e-commerce, healthcare, finance, and more.A practical guide to
               answering critical business questions, Sprint is a book for teams

               an integrated virtual planning tool called the Virtual

               find ourselves in our Element, and achieve everything we're

               irresistible wit, stylish prose and masterful storytelling that
               made A Short History of Nearly Everything one of the most lauded
               books of the last decade, and delivers one of the most
               entertaining and illuminating books ever written about the
               history of the way we live. Bill Bryson was struck one day by the
               thought that we devote a lot more time to studying the battles
               and wars of history than to considering what history really
               consists of: centuries of people quietly going about their daily
               business - eating, sleeping and merely endeavouring to get more
               comfortable. And that most of the key discoveries for humankind
               can be found in the very fabric of the houses in which we
               live.This inspired him to start a journey around his own house,
               an old rectory in Norfolk, wandering from room to room
               considering how the ordinary things in life came to be. Along the
               way he did a prodigious amount of research on the history of
               anything and everything, from architecture to electricity, from
               food preservation to epidemics, from the spice trade to the
               Eiffel Tower, from crinolines to toilets; and on the brilliant,
               creative and often eccentric minds behind them. And he discovered
               that, although there may seem to be nothing as unremarkable as
               our domestic lives, there is a huge amount of history, interest
               and excitement - and even a little danger - lurking in the
               corners of every home.",

               considers different skill and knowledge levels as well as diverse
               situations. In this study, we investigated the relationships
               between user behaviors and skill levels under operational
               conditions. We captured sixty samples of two sewing tasks
               performed by five operators using a head-mounted RGB-d camera and
               a static gaze tracker. We examined the operators’ gaze and head
               movements, and hand interactions to essential regions (hotspots)
               to determine behavioral differences among continuous skill
               improving experiences. The experimental results indicate that
               some features, such as task execution time and user head
               movements, are good indexes for skill level and provide valuable
               information that can be applied to obtain an effective task
               model. Operators with varying knowledge and operating habits
               demonstrate different operational features, which can contribute

              resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties of
              building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in

              involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM
              implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
              presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic.
              Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet,
              due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
              captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of
              information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects and
              relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite fast
              developments and spreading standards, challenging research
              opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to

              superimposing information onto the real world, has recently
              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies—localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices—which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and intuitive
              user experiences, which can increase the usability of AR. Cloud
              computing environments allow users with internet access to
              ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful, and
              less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101 research

  abstract = "Abstract Construction is a high hazard industry which involves
              many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety has
              always been advocated by many construction companies, and they
              have been working hard to make sure their employees are protected
              from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of Virtual and
              Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed trend of
              capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR applications to
              create forgiving environments for visualizing complex workplace
              situations, building up risk-preventive knowledge and undergoing
              training. To better understand the state-of-the-art of VR/AR
              applications in construction safety (VR/AR-CS) and from which to
              uncover the related issues and propose possible improvements, this
              paper starts with a review and synthesis of research evidence for
              several VR/AR prototypes, products and the related training and
              evaluation paradigms. Predicated upon a wide range of
              well-acknowledged scholarly journals, this paper comes up with a
              generic taxonomy consisting of VR/AR technology characteristics,
              application domains, safety scenarios and evaluation methods.
              According to this taxonomy, a number of technical features and
              types that could be implemented in the context of construction
              safety enhancement are derived and further elaborated, while
              significant application domains and trends regarding the VR/AR-CS
              research are generalized, i.e., hazards recognition and
              identification, safety training and education, safety instruction
              and inspection, and so on. Last but not least, this study sets
              forth a list of gaps derived from the in-depth review and comes up
              with the prospective research works. It is envisioned that the

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating BIM
              content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or her
              performance using MR. To address these topics, a quasi-experiment
              was conducted that compares the performance of eighteen electrical
              construction personnel who were tasked with building similar
              conduit assemblies using traditional paper and MR. Participants
              completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires to provide their
              perceptions of the experience. The results suggest that MR
              enabled: a significantly higher productivity rate; reduced the
              time required to understand the design; led to fewer errors during
              the assembly process; and increased the number of accurately
              constructed conduits as compared to the conduits constructed using
              traditional paper. Additionally, nearly all participants agreed
              that MR is easy to use, but most still felt that they would prefer
              to use paper plans for design communication. The findings of this
              work were noteworthy because many of the participants had
              substantial prior experience constructing conduit using paper
              plans, yet they still performed the task better and faster using
              MR. While the small sample size limits the extent to which these
              findings can be generalized, the contribution of this work is in
              demonstrating, as a proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable
              option for communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not
              currently observed through the use of a paper-based communication
              methods.",

               in formal and informal learning.We are living in a time of rapid
               advances in terms of both the capabilities and the cost of
               virtual reality, multi-user virtual environments, and various
               forms of mixed reality. These new media potentially offer
               extraordinary opportunities for enhancing both motivation and
               learning across a range of subject areas, student developmental
               levels, and educational settings. With the development of
               practical and affordable virtual reality and mixed reality,
               people now have the chance to experience immersive learning both
               in classrooms and informally in homes, libraries, and community
               centers. The book appeals to a broad readership including
               teachers, administrators, scholars, policy makers, instructional
               designers, evaluators and industry leaders.",

  abstract  = "A New York Times Bestseller A revolution is under way. In recent
               years, Google’s autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles on
               American highways and IBM’s Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies—with hardware, software,
               and networks at their core—will in the near future diagnose
               diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data
               sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once
               considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT’s Erik
               Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee—two thinkers at the forefront of
               their field—reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our
               lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies
               is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling
               personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless
               access to the cultural items that enrich our lives. Amid this
               bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of all
               kinds—from lawyers to truck drivers—will be forever upended.
               Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic
               indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and
               wages are falling even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing
               on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson
               and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a
               new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that
               it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one,
               designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power
               with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a
               radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book,
               The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of
               technological, societal, and economic progress.",

  abstract  = "How should we train? What should we learn? What is our value?
               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and the
               opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and design.
               It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various technological
               trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon future urban,
               spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within architecture.

               and more learners plugged into the online world. How can schools
               make the most of both the technology and the learning potential
               of today’s “born digital” students? In this new edition of their
               groundbreaking book, Collins and Halverson argue that new
               technologies have transformed our workplaces, our lives, and our
               culture and it is time we take the next step to transform
               learning—in and out of schools. The authors show how, over time,
               public schooling was so successful that it became synonymous with
               education. But new technologies risk making schools obsolete and
               this book explains why and how today’s educators, policymakers,
               and communities must adapt to provide all learners with access to
               the new learning tools of the 21st century.",

                 evidence of its efficacy and substantial evidence of its
                 detrimental impact on those allocated to the lowest sets.
                 Taking a Bourdieusian approach, we propose that setting can be
                 understood as a practice through which the social and cultural
                 reproduction of dominant power relations is enacted within
                 schools. Drawing on survey data from 12,178 Year 7 (age 11/12)
                 students and discussion groups and individual interviews with
                 33 students, conducted as part of a wider project on secondary
                 school grouping practices, we examine the views of students who
                 experience setting, exploring the extent to which the
                 legitimacy of the practice is accepted or challenged, focusing
                 on students’ negative views about setting. Analyses show that
                 privileged students (White, middle class) were most likely to
                 be in top sets whereas working‐class and Black students were
                 more likely to be in bottom sets. Students in the lowest sets
                 (and boys, Black students and those in receipt of free school
                 meals) were the most likely to express negative views of
                 setting and to question the legitimacy and ‘fairness’ of
                 setting as a practice, whereas top‐set students defended the
                 legitimacy of setting and set allocations as ‘natural’ and
                 ‘deserved’. This paper argues that setting is incompatible with
                 social justice approaches to education and calls for the
                 foregrounding of the views of those who are disadvantaged by
                 the practice as a tool for challenging the doxa of setting.",

               the underlying principles are universal. While this process is
               often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with
               vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging

                 Population: How, Why and When?” (also known by its acronym

              techniques to capture and analyse data (Suthers and Verbert,
              2013). We propose that the literature examining the triadic
              relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge),
              pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching) and assessment
              provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space. We
              provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the
              understandings of particular analytics are informed by this triad.
              As a detailed worked example of how one might design analytics to
              scaffold a specific form of higher order learning, we focus on the
              construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the nature of
              knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a pragmatic,
              sociocultural perspective are well placed to explore this
              construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples
              provided throughout this paper, through emphasising the

                  interactive learning environments. We describe a unique
                  ecologically valid Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) study in a classroom
                  equipped with computers, two of which were set up to allow
                  human facilitators (wizards) to listen to students
                  thinking-aloud while having access to their interaction with
                  the environment. The wizards provided support using a script
                  and following an iterative methodology that limited on purpose
                  their communication capacity in order to simulate the actual
                  system. Our results indicate that the feedback received from
                  the wizards did serve its function i.e. it helped modify
                  students' behaviour in that they did think-aloud significantly
                  more than in past interactions and rephrased their language to
                  employ mathematical terminology. Additional results from
                  student perception questionnaires show that overall students
                  find the system suggestions helpful, not repetitive and
                  understandable. Most also enjoy thinking aloud to the computer
                  but, as expected, some find the feedback cognitively
                  overloading, indicating that more work is needed on how to
                  design the interaction tipping the balance towards
                  facilitating post-task reflection.",

               chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often deflect.
               Data-driven systems, on the other hand, are often non-coherent,

               Training is a new academic journal in the field of Vocational
               Education and Training (VET). In recent years many countries have
               developed a new interest in creating or strengthening the
               vocational part of the educational system, both at the basic and
               higher education level. These developments ask for a sound
               scientific underpinning of policy decisions and have therefore
               created a new need for empirically oriented academic research in
               VET issues. The new journal will address VET-specific questions
               from different academic disciplines emphasizing empirical work
               that fulfils highest methodological and statistical standards of
               research. The journal Empirical Research in Vocational Education
               and Training will follow developments throughout the world in
               vocational training institutions and companies. The journal
               welcomes comparative studies that allow to empirically compare
               the effectiveness, efficiency and equity in different VET systems
               at the school-, company and systemic level. The journal has the
               goal to cover a broad range of topics in the VET field from all
               relevant scientific disciplines. The journal has therefore an
               international pluridisciplinary editorial board and also an
               advisory board with leading international academics in the fields
               of pedagogy, psychology, sociology and economics. The targeted
               audience of the journal are academics and researchers in the
               field of VET. In addition the empirical orientation of the
               journal should make it and interesting source of information for
               policy-makers, policy planners and administrators, school-leaders
               and trainers in the field of VET. Empirical Research in
               Vocational Education and Training publishes empirical work in all
               fields of VET from basic VET to continuous or adult learning. All
               contributions are peer reviewed by at least 2 anonymous referees.

               the magnificent work it produces, helps demonstrates the
               worldwide impact of the industry. Chapter topics include The
               construction industry at large, the “players” in construction,
               the sequence of a project, and communications and documentation.
               Appendices cover: a narrative of a project sequence; the concept
               and application of building codes and other construction

              machines in use, the less important it is to have one. These
              network effects influence consumer decisions and affect companies’
              ability to compete. Strategists have developed some well-known
              rules for navigating business environments with network effects.
              “Move first” is one, and “get big fast” is another. In a study of
              dozens of companies, however, the authors found that quite often
              the conventional wisdom was dead wrong. And when the rules failed,
              the reason was always the same: Companies trip up when they try to
              attract large volumes of customers without understanding (1) the
              strength of mutual attraction among various customer groups and
              (2) the extent of asymmetric attraction among them. Looking at
              examples such as TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, and the New York Times,
              the authors offer strategies for competing in markets with network
              effects. New entrants should focus on customer groups that they
              are uniquely positioned to serve or appeal to the most attractive
              customers in a market. Incumbents pursuing growth strategies in
              adjacent markets or new geographies should consider how similar

  abstract  = "What artificial intelligence can tell us about the mind and
               intelligent behavior.What can artificial intelligence teach us
               about the mind? If AI's underlying concept is that thinking is a
               computational process, then how can computation illuminate
               thinking? It's a timely question. AI is all the rage, and the
               buzziest AI buzz surrounds adaptive machine learning: computer
               systems that learn intelligent behavior from massive amounts of
               data. This is what powers a driverless car, for example. In this
               book, Hector Levesque shifts the conversation to “good old
               fashioned artificial intelligence,” which is based not on heaps
               of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind
               of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that
               depart from previous patterns—as we do in real life, when, for
               example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista
               informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
               of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that
               passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he
               proposes another way to test for intelligence—the Winograd Schema
               Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. “If our goal is
               to understand intelligent behavior, we had better understand the
               difference between making it and faking it,” he observes. He
               identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense and the
               capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to
               represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more
               and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without
               common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.",

               sentence--a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of
               empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and error?
               What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between
               one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another that
               prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you agree
               to share your family's full medical history if you were told that
               it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?These are just
               some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach
               the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign
               supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling us what to
               watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail.
               But as we rely on algorithms to automate big, important
               decisions--in crime, justice, healthcare, transportation, and
               money--they raise questions about what we want our world to look
               like. What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or
               preserving privacy? Protecting victims of crime or preventing
               innocent people being falsely accused? Hello World takes us on a
               tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the
               algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician
               Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings, showing us how
               algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the ways
               in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By
               weaving in relatable, real world stories with accessible
               explanations of the underlying mathematics that power algorithms,
               Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their
               limitations, and examine whether they really are improvement on
               the human systems they replace.",

  title     = "Range: Why Generalists Triumph in a Specialized World",
  author    = "Epstein, David J",
  publisher = "Riverhead Books",
  abstract  = "Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a skill,
               play an instrument, or lead their field should start early, focus
               intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate practice as
               possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch up to the
               people who got a head start. But if you take a closer look at the
               world's top performers, from professional athletes to Nobel
               laureates, you'll find that early specialization is the
               exception, not the rule. David Epstein, author of the New York
               Times bestseller The Sports Gene, studied the world's most
               successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters
               and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially
               those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not
               specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their
               path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing on
               one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make
               connections their more specialized peers can't spy from deep in
               their hyperfocused trenches. As experts silo themselves further
               while computers master more of the skills once reserved for
               highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace
               diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.
               Our obsession with getting a head start is understandable; early
               specialization feels efficient. But Epstein marshals an enormous
               body of scientific research to argue that we should all actively
               cultivate inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn.
               Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The
               most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening
               their knowledge in a single area. Provocative, rigorous, and
               engrossing, Range explains how to maintain the benefits of
               breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and
               delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes,
               even demands, hyperspecialization.",

               stand for something: challenging conventional wisdom; using data
               rather than emotion to answer questions; and learning to unravel
               the world's secret codes. Now Levitt and Dubner have gathered up
               what they have learned and turned it into a readable and
               practical toolkit for thinking differently - thinking, that is,
               like a Freak. Whether you are interested in the best way to
               improve your odds in penalty kicks, or in major global reforms,

               hot-dog-eating champion can help you, the reason an Australian
               doctor swallowed a batch of dangerous bacteria, why Nigerian
               e-mail scammers make a point of saying they're from Nigeria, and
               why Van Halen's demanding tour contract banning brown M\&Ms was
               really a safety measure. You'll learn why sometimes it's best to
               put away your moral compass, and smarter to think like a child.
               You will be given a master class in incentives-because for better
               or worse, incentives rule our world. And you will learn to quit

               factors that determine their behaviour and thus their safety. Yet
               researchers have questioned the effectiveness of conventional
               safety training. This research tested the hypotheses that safety
               training in a virtual reality (VR) construction site would be
               feasible and more effective, in terms of workers' learning and
               recall in identifying and assessing construction safety risks,
               than would equivalent training using conventional methods.
               Sixty-six subjects were provided training in construction safety
               and their safety knowledge was tested prior to the training,
               immediately afterward, and one month later. Half of the subjects
               received traditional classroom training with visual aids; the
               other half were trained using a 3D immersive VR power-wall.
               Significant advantage was found for VR training for stone
               cladding work and for cast-in-situ concrete work, but not for
               general site safety. VR training was more effective in terms of
               maintaining trainees' attention and concentration. Training with
               VR was more effective over time, especially in the context of
               cast-in-situ concrete works. Given the need for improved training
               and the advantages of training using VR, incorporation of VR in

                 plant and equipment, and safety training is considered by many
                 to be one of the best approaches to their prevention. However,
                 current safety training methods/tools are unable to provide

                 technology-based safety training platforms have the potential

               attention in recent years, the term AR was given different
               meanings by varying researchers. In this article, we first
               provide an overview of definitions, taxonomies, and technologies
               of AR. We argue that viewing AR as a concept rather than a type
               of technology would be more productive for educators,
               researchers, and designers. Then we identify certain features and
               affordances of AR systems and applications. Yet, these compelling
               features may not be unique to AR applications and can be found in
               other technological systems or learning environments (e.g.,
               ubiquitous and mobile learning environments). The instructional
               approach adopted by an AR system and the alignment among
               technology design, instructional approach, and learning
               experiences may be more important. Thus, we classify three
               categories of instructional approaches that emphasize the
               “roles,” “tasks,” and “locations,” and discuss what and how
               different categories of AR approaches may help students learn.
               While AR offers new learning opportunities, it also creates new
               challenges for educators. We outline technological, pedagogical,
               learning issues related to the implementation of AR in education.
               For example, students in AR environments may be cognitively
               overloaded by the large amount of information they encounter, the
               multiple technological devices they are required to use, and the
               complex tasks they have to complete. This article provides
               possible solutions for some of the challenges and suggests topics

               that has the “curious property of being in relation with all the
               other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or
               invent the set of relations that they happen to designate,
               mirror, or reflect” (Foucault, 1986a, p.
               24).Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws upon a range of
               literary examples and from biographical accounts of authors such
               as Alan Bennett, Michel Foucault, and Umberto Eco to show how the
               library space operates as a heterotopia.Findings– The paper finds
               that drawing together the constructs of heterotopia and
               serendipity can enrich the understanding of how libraries are
               experienced as sites of play, creativity, and
               adventure.Originality/value– Foucault’s concept of heterotopia is
               offered as an original and useful frame that can account for the
               range of experiences and associations uniquely attached to the

               and what learnings can be brought forward from case studies
               involving industry leaders. By looking at practical examples from
               the field of handheld AR breakthroughs, virtual reality (VR)
               success stories and experimental interaction concept of
               pioneering XR platforms, you'll see how it's possible to map out

               performance, while minimising economic cost and thus ensuring
               social accessibility. Across the UK, the construction industry is
               characterised by several regional differences, including the
               level of uptake of offsite production. If Scottish wood is
               produced through good silvicultural practices and is properly
               utilised in the construction sector, the import of raw material
               from other countries can be drastically reduced, with several
               advantages. In Scotland, innovation in the construction sector is
               often driven by large companies that can invest a quota of their
               turnover in research and development to create new products,
               experiment with new materials or develop more efficient methods
               of erection. The most significant drivers for offsite
               construction are considered by the Scottish respondents to be
               government policies, the housing shortage and environmental
               credentials, whereas less importance is attached to advanced
               systems and production methods.",

               displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now
               reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming
               elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of citizens
               could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious
               games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit
               from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an
               HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation
               safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft
               emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed
               approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the
               safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for
               safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing
               learning immediately after the experience but we extend our
               attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This is
               a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain safety
               procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger. A
               knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one
               week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive
               serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover,
               subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the
               study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging
               and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can
               contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we
               discuss in the paper.",

               new forms of learning. Changes in technology-enhanced
               professional learning are influenced by the inter-relationship of
               work practices, learning processes and technology systems. Based
               on an analysis of current research in professional learning with
               technologies, we identify a number of important trends. First,
               work practice tends to be agile and constantly changing so
               professionals are tending to use technologies to support
               just-in-time learning alongside formal professional training and
               education. Second, with widespread adoption of digital media in
               society, there appears to be increasing reliance on
               recommendations from AI systems for learning alongside guidance
               from workplace mentors or experts. Third, employers and employees
               want to find ways to extend assessment of formal educational
               qualifications through accreditation of the outcomes of informal,
               work-integrated learning. To shape the ongoing transformation of
               both work(places) and learning, the chapter highlights the ways
               diverse disciplines need to align reflectively, critically, and
               constructively to bring together theories and methods from
               learning sciences, computer science and human-computer
               interaction to identify problems and engineer solutions. Finally,
               we propose three constructs that are critical for
               technology-enhanced professional learning, but often are not
               taken into consideration: the goals and motivations of learners,
               the work environment and structure, and the tools and resources
               available for work and learning.",

               evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of this
               book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40\% of all
               training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail to
               reach their potential for learning effectiveness and efficiency.
               This guide provides research-based guidelines on how best to
               present content with text, graphics, and audio as well as the
               conditions under which those guidelines are most effective. This
               updated fourth edition describes the guidelines, psychology, and
               applications for ways to improve learning through personalization
               techniques, coherence, animations, and a new chapter on
               evidence-based game design. The chapter on the Cognitive Theory
               of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms of cognitive load
               which are revisited throughout each chapter as the psychological
               basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on engagement in
               learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews of how to
               leverage worked examples, practice, online collaboration, and
               learner control to optimize learning. The updated instructor's
               materials include a syllabus, assignments, storyboard projects,
               and test items that you can adapt to your own course schedule and
               students. Co-authored by the most productive instructional
               research scientist in the world, Dr. Richard E. Mayer, this book
               distills copious e-learning research into a practical manual for
               improving learning through optimal design and delivery. Get up to
               date on the latest e-learning research Adopt best practices for
               communicating information effectively Use evidence-based

               ideas, such as learning styles with evidence-based guidelines

               e-Learning continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the
               classroom, and correspondingly, has become a focus among
               researchers in learning-related fields. New findings from
               research laboratories can inform the design and development of
               e-learning. However, much of this research published in technical
               journals is inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning
               material. By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume
               and translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning
               and the Science of Instruction has become an essential resource

  abstract  = "The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing, role;
               while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts, or
               indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that, in
               large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands it
               places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as the
               proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the false
               idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or social
               critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics of
               belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he also
               questions the role of the social research within society and what
               it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It
               tackles the major issues of contemporary social research

               enable us to understand entrepreneurship. A general model is
               presented which argues that personality and human capital

               action strategies on success. The same is also true of the
               environment. In earlier times, personality factors were
               emphasized by psychological researchers on entrepreneurship.
               There are good reasons to do this; however, modern research goes
               beyond this and differentiates more sharply between emergence of
               firms and firm success, and looks in more detail at contingencies
               between person and environmental factors. The actions of the
               entrepreneur are crucial for the firm's chances to survive and
               thrive in the market. All those psychological constructs that are

               classic Mincerian approach. Consistent with previous studies, we
               find positive returns to college-level credits, even among
               students who did not earn a credential. When accounting for the
               total number of college-level credits accumulated, we find
               significant “sheepskin effects,” the value of an educational
               award as a signal apart from the skills actually associated with
               earning that degree—associated with associate and bachelor’s
               degree receipt but no consistently positive sheepskin effects for
               short-term and long-term certificates. However, analysis by field
               of study reveals highly differentiated results, both in terms of
               returns to credits and the sheepskin effects. Lastly, we find
               that returns to credits and to award receipt differ among younger
               and older students, which suggests different educational needs
               and benefits for students at different points in their careers.",

               Education critically analyses the specific challenges relating to

               the diverse nature of learners and the variety of educational
               contexts. It focuses on the journeys to becoming teacher
               educators, their relevant teaching know-how and professional
               needs. This book combines theoretical frameworks with both
               qualitative and quantitative data to outline the pathways,
               professional identities, knowledge, and continuous professional
               development of teacher educators. This data is used to discuss
               the four main themes. The first deals with the teacher educators’
               initial disciplinary areas, journey-making to be educators, and
               the current titles/positions. The next one delineates the
               know-how (knowledge, experiences, capacities and skill sets) to
               perform as teacher educators. The third one relates to their
               professional identities and the final topic, their professional
               requirements as FE teacher educators. Contributing to the field
               of further and vocational education, this book will be of great

               learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education and
               epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories and
               empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual framework
               of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and skill sets
               play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case studies of
               professions ranging from conventional occupations of acting,
               detective work, international road transportation to emerging
               professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional therapy and
               opinion leadership. This book will be of great interest for
               academics, scholars and postgraduate students who are engaged in
               the study of informal education, vocational education and
               occupation-related programmes. It will also offer significant
               insights for related education practitioners wanting to have
               greater understanding of their own journeys and practices.",

  abstract  = "How the obsession with quantifying human performance threatens
               business, medicine, education, government—and the quality of our
               livesToday, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the belief
               that the path to success is quantifying human performance,
               publicizing the results, and dividing up the rewards based on the
               numbers. But in our zeal to instill the evaluation process with
               scientific rigor, we've gone from measuring performance to
               fixating on measuring itself—and this tyranny of metrics now
               threatens the quality of our organizations and lives. In this
               brief, accessible, and powerful book, Jerry Muller uncovers the
               damage metrics are causing and shows how we can begin to fix the
               problem. Filled with examples from business, medicine, education,
               government, and other fields, the book explains why paying for
               measured performance doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may
               increase deaths, and much more. But Muller also shows that, when
               used as a complement to judgment based on personal experience,
               metrics can be beneficial, and he includes an invaluable
               checklist of when and how to use them. The result is an essential
               corrective to a harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.",

               to mid-twentieth century, and has continued in a cyclical pattern

               with the prefab house and discusses some of the complications

               history of twentieth-century architect-led prefabricated housing
               illustrates, architecture has tended to co-opt industrial
               advances to support existing ideologies.",

               the concept of montage as a driver for establishing a new

               potential to unleash and introduce dynamics and tension in

               engender a new industrial conception of architecture. Off-site

               appropriately put together as assemblages of what the and future

               represent a new way to look at what is already there: an
               industrially produced architecture. The chapter argues that the
               new view can help facilitate a more active and strategic use of
               the present and the future building industry in order to create
               architecture, not just construction, specifically attached to
               time, place and cultural context, not just an expression of
               smooth processes or cost-efficient solutions.",

  abstract  = "A vital and underappreciated dimension of social interaction is
               the way individuals justify their actions to others,
               instinctively drawing on their experience to appeal to principles
               they hope will command respect. Individuals, however, often
               misread situations, and many disagreements can be explained by
               people appealing, knowingly and unknowingly, to different
               principles. On Justification is the first English translation of
               Luc Boltanski and Laurent Thévenot's ambitious theoretical
               examination of these phenomena, a book that has already had a
               huge impact on French sociology and is likely to have a similar
               influence in the English-speaking world. In this foundational
               work of post-Bourdieu sociology, the authors examine a wide range
               of situations where people justify their actions. The authors
               argue that justifications fall into six main logics exemplified
               by six authors: civic (Rousseau), market (Adam Smith), industrial
               (Saint-Simon), domestic (Bossuet), inspiration (Augustine), and
               fame (Hobbes). The authors show how these justifications
               conflict, as people compete to legitimize their views of a
               situation.On Justification is likely to spark important debates
               across the social sciences.",

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third new

               business toward industrialized construction through the creation
               of a spinoff factories. The chapter includes examples of the
               three business models and concludes with a discussion of how new

  abstract  = "Slicing through blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon
               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you’re convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a rigorously
               researched but counterintuitive model of market activity that
               emphasizes what people designing products or launching startups
               soon discover—the inherent difficulties of connecting individuals
               to things. Callon’s model is founded upon the notion of
               “singularization,” the premise that goods and services must adapt
               and be adapted to the local milieu of every individual whose life
               they enter. Person by person, thing by thing, Callon demonstrates
               that for ordinary economic transactions to emerge en masse,
               singular connections must be made.Pushing us to see markets as
               more than abstract interfaces where pools of anonymous buyers and
               sellers meet, Callon draws our attention to the exhaustively
               creative practices that market professionals continuously devise
               to entangle people and things. Markets in the Making exemplifies
               how prototypes, fragile curiosities that have only just been
               imagined, are gradually honed into predictable objects and
               practices. Once these are active enough to create a desired
               effect, yet passive enough to be transferred from one place to
               another without disruption, they will have successfully achieved
               the status of “goods” or “services.” The output of this more
               ample process of innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we
               recognize as “the market”—commercial activity, at scale.The
               capstone of an influential research career at the forefront of
               science and technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently
               integrates the empirical perspective of product engineering with
               the values of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing
               how markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.",

               papers has been to understand workplace learning and the ways in
               which it can be enhanced. By drawing on leading edge research
               from a number of countries and different disciplinary
               backgrounds, this book provides a synthesis of theory and
               empirical research. A key theme running through all the chapters
               is that learning that takes place in the workplace is highly
               contextualized. This requires a focus on the learner, the process
               of learning and a range of sources of learning other than
               structured and intentional interventions by teachers and
               trainers. Nevertheless, this focus on learning rather than
               teaching does not mean a focus on the learner as an individual.
               Individuals learn through their membership of social groups and
               the workplace is par excellence a site for participating in the
               social relations of production. The context of learning can be
               conceptualized at a number of different levels, requiring an
               understanding of societal, institutional and organizational
               structures, as well as the social relations of work groups and

                 personalized learning environments and the initial results of

               Suchman argues that the planning model of interaction favoured by
               the majority of AI researchers does not take sufficient account
               of the situatedness of most human social behaviour. The problems
               that can arise as a result are pertinently, and often amusingly,
               illustrated by the careful analysis of a recorded interaction
               between novice users and an intelligent machine, whose design has
               failed to accommodate essential resources of successful human
               communication. Plans and Situated Actions presents a compelling
               case for the re-examination of current models underlying
               interface design. Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh
               characterisation of human-computer interaction which also
               incorporates recent insights from the social sciences provides a
               challenge that everyone interested in machine intelligence will

               or, more accurately, multiple housing crises. A massive housing
               shortage in major cities has resulted in skyrocketing rents. Low-
               and middle-income individuals find themselves priced out of the
               places with the most opportunity. Homelessness is rampant in
               cities across the country. Developers often face the steepest
               obstacles to building in the places where new housing is needed
               most. And young people are increasingly viewing homeownership,
               once a vital part of the American dream, as hopelessly out of
               reach. These outcomes weren’t inevitable. Plenty of other
               countries supply their populations with high-quality housing at
               lower prices. And the solutions here are incredibly simple: Build
               more housing in places where it’s needed, build cheaper forms of
               housing, build housing alongside public transit, provide more
               housing vouchers. So why don’t we act on them?",

                 as the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to
                 interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for
                 curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical approach.
                 VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge, skills, and
                 confidence to engage in work and make a difference in the
                 transformation of work. This chapter argues that learners have
                 to be provided with opportunities to actively engage in
                 innovation at work to experience what is needed to deal with
                 uncertainty and to organize their own learning in such
                 circumstances. In the Netherlands, the challenges of building
                 regional networks and participating in regional innovation are
                 being taken up by higher professional education (HPE). This

               locates those changes in the wider context of the need for

               event with three principal characteristics - It is unpredictable;
               it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an
               explanation that makes it appear less random, and more
               predictable, than it was. Why do we not acknowledge the
               phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the
               answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn
               specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We
               concentrate on things we already know and time and time again
               fail to take into consideration what we don't know. We are,

               2045, reality is an ugly place. The only time Wade Watts really
               feels alive is when he’s jacked into the OASIS, a vast virtual
               world where most of humanity spends their days. When the
               eccentric creator of the OASIS dies, he leaves behind a series of
               fiendish puzzles, based on his obsession with the pop culture of
               decades past. Whoever is first to solve them will inherit his
               vast fortune—and control of the OASIS itself. Then Wade cracks
               the first clue. Suddenly he’s beset by rivals who’ll kill to take

               Each job includes ways of doing things that would be
               inappropriate for those outside the guild to know. Illusions are
               essential for maintaining occupational reputation, but in the
               process they create a set of moral dilemmas. So it is with
               ethnographic work. This article describes the underside of
               ethnographic work: compromises that one frequently makes with
               idealized ethical standards. It argues that images of
               ethnographers—personal and public—are based on partial truths or
               self-deceptions. The focus is on three clusters of dilemmas: the
               classical virtues (the kindly ethnographer, the friendly
               ethnographer, and the honest ethnographer), technical skills (the
               precise ethnographer, the observant ethnographer, and the
               unobtrusive ethnographer), and the ethnographic self (the candid
               ethnographer, the chaste ethnographer, the fair ethnographer, and
               the literary ethnographer). Changes in ethnographic styles and
               traditions alter the balance of these deceptions but do not
               eliminate the need for methodological illusions.",

               dwellings and neighborhoods are facing challenges of philosophy
               and form. Past approaches no longer sustain new demands and
               require innovative thinking. The need for a new outlook is
               propelled by fundamental changes that touch upon environmental,
               economic and social aspects. The depletion of non-renewable
               natural resources and climate change are a few of the
               environmental challenges. Increasing costs of material, labor,
               land and infrastructure have posed economic challenges with
               affordability being paramount among them. Social challenges are
               also drawing the attention of designers, builders and homeowners.
               Walkable communities, aging in place and multigenerational living
               are some of the concepts considered. In addition, live-work

               engaging and retaining the very best talent has never been more
               important.Crucially, these employees should be a diverse group of
               people with different approaches, skills and strengths in
               problem-solving and driving innovation. As well as focusing on

               outperforming the competition and achieving sustainable business

               what neurodiversity is, why it's important and what the benefits
               are. It covers how to attract, recruit and engage neurodiverse
               talent and provides guidance on how to adapt HR policies,
               processes and workplaces to ensure that all employees, including
               the 2 in 10 employees in the UK who are neurodiverse, can reach
               their full potential. Neurodiversity at Work is packed full of
               case studies from leading organizations like Microsoft who are
               already seeing the productivity, performance and financial
               benefits of neurodiversity in the workplace. Individuals in these

               relationship between buildings and energyThe story of
               architecture is the story of humanity. The buildings we live in,
               from the humblest pre-historic huts to today's skyscrapers,
               reveal our priorities and ambitions, our family structures and
               power structures. And to an extent never explored until now,
               architecture has been shaped in every era by our access to
               energy, from fire to farming to fossil fuels.In this
               ground-breaking history of world architecture, Barnabas Calder
               takes us on a dazzling tour of some of the most astonishing
               buildings of the past fifteen thousand years, from Uruk, via
               Ancient Rome and Victorian Liverpool, to China's booming
               megacities. He reveals how every building - from the Parthenon to
               the Great Mosque of Damascus to a typical Georgian house - was
               influenced by the energy available to its architects, and why
               this matters.Today architecture consumes so much energy that 40\%
               of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from the
               construction and running of buildings. If we are to avoid
               catastrophic climate change then now, more than ever, we need
               beautiful but also intelligent architecture, and to retrofit -
               not demolish - the buildings we already have.",

               academic, capped by sharing the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics
               and the Nobel Peace Prize, and honorary degrees from Harvard,
               Cambridge, Oxford and more than fifty other universities, and
               elected not only to the National Academy of Sciences and the
               American Academy of Arts and Letters but the Royal Society and
               the British Academy; a public servant, who served as Chair of
               President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and Chief
               Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank, headed
               international commissions for the UN and France, and was awarded
               the French Legion of Honor and Australia's Sydney Peace Prize; a
               public intellectual whose numerous books on vital topics have
               been best sellers. What brought him to economics were his
               concerns about the inequality and discrimination he saw growing
               up. Wanting to understand what drives it and what can be done
               about it has been his lifelong passion. This book gathers
               together and extends to new frontiers this lifelong work, drawing
               upon the challenges and insights of each of these phases of his
               career. In a still very widely cited paper written fifty years
               ago, Stiglitz set forth the fundamental framework for analyzing
               intergenerational transfer of wealth and advantage, which plays a
               central role in persistent inequality. That and subsequent work,
               developed most fully here for the first time, described today's
               inequality as a result of centrifugal forces increasing
               inequality and centripetal forces reducing it. In recent decades,
               the centrifugal forces have strengthened, the centripetal forces
               weakened. His general theory provides a framework for
               understanding the marked growth in inequality in recent decades,
               and for devising policies to reduce it. A central message is that
               ever-increasing inequality is not inevitable. Inequality is, in a
               fundamental sense, a choice. Stiglitz explains that inequality
               does not largely arise from differences in savings rates between
               capitalists and others, though that may play a role (as Piketty,
               Marx, and Kaldor suggest); but rather, it originates importantly
               from the rules of the game, which have weakened the bargaining
               power of workers as they have increased the market power of
               corporations. He also explains how monetary authorities have
               contributed to increasing wealth inequality, and how, unless
               something is done about it, likely changes in technology such as
               AI and robotization will make matters worse. He describes
               policies that can simultaneously reduce inequality and improve
               economic performance.",

               more than forty interviews with Steve Jobs conducted over two

               is the acclaimed, internationally bestselling biography of the
               ultimate icon of inventiveness. Walter Isaacson tells the story
               of the rollercoaster life and searingly intense personality of
               creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious

               excellent availability and customer service. Production Planning

               What if you stopped trying to do everything, so that you could
               finally get round to what counts?We're obsessed with our
               lengthening to-do lists, our overfilled inboxes, the struggle
               against distraction, and the sense that our attention spans are
               shrivelling. Still, we rarely make the connection between our
               daily struggles with time and the ultimate time management
               problem: the question of how best to use our ridiculously brief
               time on the planet, which amounts on average to about four
               thousand weeks. Four Thousand Weeks is an uplifting, engrossing
               and deeply realistic exploration of the challenge. Rejecting the
               futile modern obsession with 'getting everything done,' it
               introduces readers to tools for constructing a meaningful life by
               embracing rather than denying their limitations. And it shows how
               the unhelpful ways we've come to think about time aren't
               inescapable, unchanging truths, but choices we've made, as
               individuals and as a society. Its many revelations will transform

               recent developments. This bestselling visual reference helps both
               students and professionals understand the vocabulary of
               architectural design by examining how space and form are ordered
               in the environment. Essential and timeless, the fundamental
               elements of space and form still present a challenge to those who
               crave a deeper understanding. Taking a critical look at the
               evolution of spaces, Architecture distills complex concepts of
               design into a clear focus that inspires, bringing difficult
               abstractions to life. The book is illustrated throughout to
               demonstrate the concepts presented, and show the relationships
               between fundamental elements of architecture through the ages and
               across cultures.",

               or that trying harder is the key. Award-winning writers,
               productivity coaches and co-founders of Prolifiko Bec Evans and
               Chris Smith know this isn't true. Having coached over 10,000
               writers, they've learned that productivity is personal. Their
               unique, results-driven approach is designed to help you find a
               realistic and sustainable practice that will get you to the end
               of any writing project, no matter how stuck you feel. Applying
               research from neuroscience and psychology, and based on the
               authors' own practice and findings, Written will show you how to
               manage your time effectively, how to visualise and set successful
               goals, how to recover from setbacks, and ultimately how to create
               writing habits that work for you. Along the way, you'll hear
               inspiring and relatable stories from other writers who have

               at the construction site. Modularization is a philosophy change!
               And along with that change, comes the need to understand the
               implementation requirements and project mindset adjustments that
               impact and influence all aspects of the modular project. To
               accomplish this, the book provides a complete (from beginning to

               modular project unique, starting with the very basics in terms of
               definitions and setting the groundwork of expectations by
               identifying benefits and challenges. Then, because the journey is
               as important as the destination, the reader is guided through the
               various project phases in a manner that reflects how they would
               be addressed in the workplace. From the very earliest

               selection of the optimal choice to be finally carried into
               detailed design, the reader is acquainted with each phase of the

               Gaming and simulation have already proven their efficacy in
               solving problems in science and business. However, the next
               challenge is designing data-rich virtual environments that can
               enhance clients' spatial understanding, simplify architect-client
               communications, provide customisation options, consolidate
               quantification, and export data directly to manufacturers'
               software, minimizing fragmentation across the entire building
               information management (BIM) lifecycle. With this book,

  abstract  = "Activity theory -- a conceptual framework originally developed by
               Aleksei Leontiev -- has its roots in the socio-cultural tradition
               in Russian psychology. The foundational concept of the theory is
               human activity, which is understood as purposeful, mediated, and
               transformative interaction between human beings and the world.
               Since the early 1990s, activity theory has been a visible
               landmark in the theoretical landscape of Human-Computer
               Interaction (HCI). Along with some other frameworks, such as
               distributed cognition and phenomenology, it established itself as
               a leading post-cognitivist approach in HCI and interaction
               design. In this book we discuss the conceptual foundations of
               activity theory and its contribution to HCI research. After
               making the case for theory in HCI and briefly discussing the
               contribution of activity theory to the field (Chapter One) we
               introduce the historical roots, main ideas, and principles of
               activity theory (Chapter Two). After that we present in-depth
               analyses of three issues which we consider of special importance
               to current developments in HCI and interaction design, namely:
               agency (Chapter Three), experience (Chapter Four), and
               activity-centric computing (Chapter Five). We conclude the book
               with reflections on challenges and prospects for further
               development of activity theory in HCI (Chapter Six). Table of

               work done), but also because it has implications for the meaning
               and legitimacy of work. Expertise confers power. Building on
               previous work that has compartmentalized expertise differences
               according to discrete knowledge areas or knowledge typologies, we
               enumerate a taxonomy of expertise forms: technical, arcane,
               relational, and embodied. This taxonomy illuminates how the
               practice of expertise involves knowledge about the technical
               properties of work; the policies, standards, and laws that govern
               it; the people involved; and a material sense of the spaces in
               which work takes place. We argue that experts must negotiate the
               multiplicity of their expertise in their interaction with
               different audiences and that these forms of expertise involve
               differing standards of legitimate performance, differing

               deficit. Modular integrated construction (MiC), which has the
               highest level of prefabrication among off-site construction
               manufacturing (OSM), has been adopted as a fast and reliable
               construction method to address the housing deficit. Previous
               studies have assessed the productivity of the prefabrication
               stage of MiC, while investigations into the productivity of the
               MiC installation process with the consideration of pragmatic
               factors, especially for high-rise buildings, are lacking in the
               literature. Therefore, this study contributes by (1) developing a
               discrete-event simulation (DES) model to assess the productivity
               of MiC installation while considering pragmatic factors (e.g.,
               weather conditions, topography, work dimension, etc.) and
               management conditions (e.g., workers’ motivation, training,
               equipment maintenance, etc.); (2) developing a mathematical model
               to understand the relationship between productivity and various
               resources utilized in MiC installation. After verifying and
               validating the DES model, it was applied to a case study in Hong
               Kong. A sensitivity analysis using a full factorial experiment
               design was conducted to identify the parameters (e.g., number of
               trucks, tower cranes, different crews) that significantly affect
               a number of performance measures, such as the project duration,
               productivity, and total costs. Furthermore, the mathematical
               model shows high prediction accuracy, as the mean absolute
               percentage error is 8.93\%. This study would help construction
               practitioners in their decision-making process, while planning a
               project by providing them with a model that can predict the
               productivity of the MiC installation process before and during

               knowing this, What should thesis students do to write for their

               students is: first, treat your examiners as friends who want you
               to pass, and write calmly without agonising about getting it
               perfect. Aim to make your thesis reader-friendly, and do a
               thorough proofread to remove distracting errors. Identify the
               field(s) you will contribute to, and make your thesis interesting
               and convincing for examiners from this field. Write a draft, get
               feedback and use this to improve your thesis. Help your examiners
               to follow your train of thought: explain what you are doing and
               why, especially if your thesis differs from what they would
               expect. Convince your examiners that you have a sound
               interpretation of the literature, an important topic and an
               appropriate method, and that your conclusions make a significant,
               publishable contribution to your field. When you have submitted,

  abstract  = "A decade ago, massively open online courses (MOOCs) were heralded
               as the solution to universal, global access to higher education.
               While they failed to reach this vision, primarily because of
               teaching-by-telling and learning-by-listening (a PDF of the
               residential classroom), MOOCs provided the foundational models
               and infrastructure for emergency remote learning in the pandemic.
               Reports of remote learning’s death post-pandemic are greatly
               exaggerated, since the world is now irreversibly hybrid—and will
               stay that way because many people and organizations value the new
               opportunities this presents. From now on, when students leave the
               shelter of classrooms to interact with the world beyond
               schooling, they must have skills for adept performance both
               face-to-face and across distance. Colleges, universities, and
               regions that force all teaching and learning to be face-to-face
               are dooming their graduates to reduced agency in every other
               aspect of life. As discussed in recent reports from Harvard, MIT,
               and Stanford, innovative approaches to digital learning were
               developed during the pandemic that are now improving campus-based
               learning. Insights from these approaches offer the opportunity
               for student engagement at scale, taking advantage of strengths of
               online instruction such as collapsing time, bridging space,
               personalizing via rich datastreams, using AI-based instructional
               assistants and learning partners, delivering content and
               experience across universities, and sustaining online learning
               communities after formal instruction ends. Combined, these
               advances can enable next-generation massive digital hybrid
               learning, a means to achieve the aspirational vision of universal
               global access to higher education. A coalition of higher
               education institutions could begin to realize this vision, an
               essential step in enabling all learners to survive and thrive in
               our increasingly turbulent, disruptive global economy and

                   However, even state-of-the-art models still regularly produce
                   logical mistakes. To train more reliable models, we can turn
                   either to outcome supervision, which provides feedback for a
                   final result, or process supervision, which provides feedback
                   for each intermediate reasoning step. Given the importance of
                   training reliable models, and given the high cost of human
                   feedback, it is important to carefully compare the both
                   methods. Recent work has already begun this comparison, but
                   many questions still remain. We conduct our own
                   investigation, finding that process supervision significantly
                   outperforms outcome supervision for training models to solve
                   problems from the challenging MATH dataset. Our
                   process-supervised model solves 78\% of problems from a

               research based on a quali-quantitative methodology within one of
               the largest hospitals in Southern Italy.Findings This study
               allowed to achieve several results that could be significant and
               relevant within the health-care sector. First, this paper
               identified some of the main working practices and their
               associated activities in health care. Moreover, this paper
               identified the main organizational forms and/or tools enabling

               knowledge for each of the prior identified practices.Practical

                 This new prospective approach is in contrast to the existing
                 skill-based retrospective approach, which has come to dominate
                 VET research and policymaking. VET has paid a price for
                 becoming overly institutionalized within national education and
                 training systems and, as a consequence, initial preparation of
                 young people for the labor market. We argue that a close

                 vocational education necessitates placing individuals centrally
                 in those deliberations. The geneses of national vocational
                 education systems, and their form, goals, and practices, are
                 increasingly shaped by institutional factors, which Dewey
                 (1916) refers to as the ?social side.? They extend to the
                 provision of detailed national prespecified outcomes, course
                 content, forms of assessment, and so on. Yet, the efficacy and
                 continuity of these educational provisions arise in response to
                 how individuals engage, learn, and remake them?what Dewey
                 refers to as the ?personal side??albeit in interdependent ways.
                 That is, there is mutual dependence between the personal and
                 social sides. Regardless of whether it is directed to pragmatic
                 purposes or educational efficacy, vocational education relies
                 on individual experiencing and engagement, interdependently.
                 Ultimately, individuals enact vocational education provisions,
                 learn from and through them, prompt changes within them, and
                 realize their intended purposes.",

                 expertise is used, developed, and sustained (over time) in
                 practice. It argues that the development of teachers? expertise
                 in vocational contexts is a complex, diffuse, and largely
                 hidden process, residing both within the individual as personal
                 expertise and/or within networks as shared vocational
                 knowledge. The chapter employs two different but complementary
                 research methodologies (cultural historical activity theory and
                 actor?network theory) as analytical lenses to explore and make
                 visible the phenomenon of vocational practice in action.
                 Examples are given from a range of case studies of both
                 vocational trainee teachers and experienced vocational
                 teachers. The chapter concludes by arguing for new ways to

                 these developments have been the widespread adoption of
                 competency-based training (CBT) and a shift toward greater

               neurobehavioral disorder that is highly prevalent in children and
               adults. An increasing number of patients with ADHD are
               self-medicating with cannabis, despite a lack of evidence on
               efficacy and safety. This case report describes 3 males (ages 18,
               22, and 23) who have integrated cannabis into their treatment
               regimen with positive results. Semistructured interviews
               conducted with the patients describe subjective improvements in
               symptoms and on quality of life. Improvements on validated rating
               scales conducted post-cannabis initiation, compared to
               pre-cannabis initiation obtained from the medical chart,
               corroborated their personal accounts. Scores on the PHQ-9
               (measuring depression) improved by 8–22 points (30–81\%), and the
               SCARED (measuring anxiety) ranged from 0 to 27 points (up to
               33\%). Improvements on the CEER-9 scale (measuring regulation)
               ranged from 2 to 7 points (22–78\%), and the 9-item SNAP scale
               (measuring inattention) showed improvements of 2–8 points
               (7–30\%). Mild adverse events including short-term memory
               problems, dry mouth, and sleepiness were reported. Blood samples
               were also collected from the patients to determine the plasma
               concentrations of the cannabinoids and relevant metabolites
               before and after a cannabis administration. After cannabis use,
               the plasma levels for CBD and THC ranged from 0 to 15.29 ng/mL
               and 1.32 to 13.76 ng/mL, respectively. Cannabinoids, however,
               were not detected prior to dosing, suggesting that cannabis
               played a complimentary role in the therapeutic regimen of these 3
               patients. Clinical trials are recommended to confirm the efficacy
               of cannabis in the treatment of ADHD.",

               book contains two sections: first, general critiques of the
               limits of current notions of a knowledge economy and required
               adult learning, in terms of historical comparisons,
               socio-political construction and current empirical evidence;
               secondly, specific challenges to presumed relations between work
               requirements and learning through case studies in diverse current
               workplaces that document richer learning processes than knowledge
               economy advocates intimate. Many of the leading authors in the
               field are represented. There are no other books to date that both
               critically assess the limits of the notion of the knowledge
               economy and examine closely the relation of workplace
               restructuring to lifelong learning beyond the confines of formal
               higher education and related educational policies. This reader
               provides a distinctive overview for future studies of relations
               between work and learning in contemporary societies beyond
               caricatures of the knowledge economy. The book should be of

               learning at work and how they, in turn, become the catalyst for
               the creation of artefacts that have a purpose and existence
               beyond the life cycle of an accreditation process. The context
               for the paper is the UK’s automotive manufacturing industry, a
               sector that has undergone considerable change over the past
               thirty or so years and has been under intense pressure to improve
               standards. The paper presents evidence from case studies of two
               companies that produce parts for global car manufacturers. These
               companies have introduced competence-based approaches in order to
               audit and assess the skills of their workforces in response to
               demands from the companies they supply that they can prove their
               employees are working to the required international quality
               standards. The competence-based approach, which is contested in
               the academic literature, has enabled employees to gain National
               Vocational Qualifications (NVQs), which, in turn, are still
               controversial some twenty years after they were first introduced.
               The paper argues that a competence-based approach can be
               beneficial to both organisations and individuals, but the
               ambiguities inherent in the NVQ model of competence create
               tensions and opportunities for restrictive as well as expansive
               forms implementation.",

                 material shall be fulfilled. Here we assess the global and

                 land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an
                 open-source land system model. We show that if 90\% of the new
                 urban population would be housed in newly built urban mid-rise
                 buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2
                 could be saved by 2100. Forest plantations would need to expand
                 by up to 149 Mha by 2100 and harvests from unprotected natural
                 forests would increase. Our results indicate that expansion of

               different teaching approaches were found to present different
               levels of difficulty for students. For example, live sessions and
               the integration of virtual reality/augmented reality (VR /AR)
               technology presented greater challenges. Conversely,
               collaborative group work and online courses focused on developing
               professional skills were found to be beneficial. The study also
               highlighted the importance of feedback and instructor support in
               online learning environments. In general, the results of our
               study suggest that the adoption of blended learning in education
               can lead to positive outcomes. However, it is important to
               emphasize the importance of careful planning and thoughtful
               consideration of optimal pedagogical strategies.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used in
                 healthcare settings as recent technological advancements create
                 possibilities for diagnosis and treatment. VR is a technology
                 that uses a headset to simulate a reality in which the user is
                 immersed in a virtual environment, creating the impression that
                 the user is physically present in this virtual space. Despite
                 the potential added value of virtual reality technology in
                 healthcare, its uptake in clinical practice is still in its
                 infancy and challenges arise in the implementation of VR.
                 Effective implementation could improve the adoption, uptake,
                 and impact of VR. However, these implementation procedures
                 still seem to be understudied in practice. This scoping review
                 aimed to examine the current state of affairs in the
                 implementation of VR technology in healthcare settings and to
                 provide an overview of factors related to the implementation of
                 VR. METHODS: To give an overview of relevant literature, a
                 scoping review was undertaken of articles published up until
                 February 2022, guided by the methodological framework of Arksey
                 and O'Malley (2005). The databases Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of
                 Science were systematically searched to identify records that
                 highlighted the current state of affairs regarding the
                 implementation of VR in healthcare settings. Information about
                 each study was extracted using a structured data extraction
                 form. RESULTS: Of the 5523 records identified, 29 were included
                 in this study. Most studies focused on barriers and
                 facilitators to implementation, highlighting similar factors
                 related to the behavior of adopters of VR and the practical
                 resources the organization should arrange for. However, few
                 studies focus on systematic implementation and on using a
                 theoretical framework to guide implementation. Despite the
                 recommendation of using a structured, multi-level
                 implementation intervention to support the needs of all
                 involved stakeholders, there was no link between the identified
                 barriers and facilitators, and specific implementation
                 objectives or suitable strategies to overcome these barriers in
                 the included articles. CONCLUSION: To take the implementation
                 of VR in healthcare to the next level, it is important to
                 ensure that implementation is not studied in separate studies
                 focusing on one element, e.g., healthcare provider-related
                 barriers, as is common in current literature. Based on the
                 results of this study, we recommend that the implementation of
                 VR entails the entire process, from identifying barriers to
                 developing and employing a coherent, multi-level implementation
                 intervention with suitable strategies. This implementation
                 process could be supported by implementation frameworks and
                 ideally focus on behavior change of stakeholders such as
                 healthcare providers, patients, and managers. This in turn
                 might result in increased uptake and use of VR technologies
                 that are of added value for healthcare practice.",

               training is gaining increasing importance in vocational education
               and training (VET). However, while IVR is primarily investigated
               and utilized in technical domains, its implementation and the
               resulting effects in commercial education remain largely
               unexplored. Moreover, the experience of motion sickness is a
               widely reported phenomenon while using IVR, which can interfere
               with cognitive processes and should therefore be considered more
               closely in terms of learning and instruction. This explorative
               study focuses on domain-specific knowledge acquisition in
               vocational apprenticeship for retailers and the accompanying side
               effects on students’ wellbeing in an IVR-based learning
               environment. For this purpose, an IVR-based scenario in a virtual
               supermarket was developed and tested with trainees in the field
               of retail at a German commercial vocational school. Using a
               quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design, we compared the
               effects of IVR-based and conventional instruction on
               domain-specific knowledge acquisition in a sample of first-year
               trainees (N = 79). The findings indicate an advantage of IVR in
               the acquisition of domain-specific knowledge (ɳ2 = .261).
               Although moderate motion sickness symptoms were reported in the
               experimental group, no direct links between the experience of
               motion sickness and learning outcomes could be identified. These
               findings advance the current knowledge about learning-related
               effects of IVR-based instruction in the field of VET and provide
               further understanding about the special conditions of IVR
               scenarios conducive to learning.",

               therefore depict a relevant research area deeply rooted in
               computer supported cooperative work (CSCW). Building on the
               theory of hierarchical opposition by Louis Dumont and empirical
               data collected through ethnographic research at a company

               shop floor setting, which require communication to flow against
               the hierarchical slope between planning and execution functions.
               By applying an organisational lens to the concept of workarounds,
               this paper contributes a novel empirical analysis that confirms

               recent years in various domains, such as education and training.
               Presence, which can be described as `the sense of being there' is
               one of the most important user experience aspects in VR. There
               are several components, which may affect the level of presence,
               such as interaction, visual fidelity, and auditory cues. In
               recent years, a significant effort has been put into increasing
               the sense of presence in VR. This study focuses on improving user
               experience in VR by increasing presence through increased
               interaction fidelity and enhanced illusions. Interaction in real
               life includes mutual and bidirectional encounters between two or
               more individuals through shared tangible objects. However, the
               majority of VR interaction to date has been unidirectional. This
               research aims to bridge this gap by enabling bidirectional mutual
               tangible embodied interactions between human users and virtual
               characters in world-fixed VR through real-virtual shared objects
               that extend from virtual world into the real world. I hypothesize

               between the real and virtual worlds (through virtual characters
               that affect the physical world), increase the seamlessness of the
               VR system (enhance the illusion) and the fidelity of interaction,
               and increase the level of presence and social presence, enjoyment
               and engagement. This paper includes the motivation, design and

               structural behaviour through problem solving exercises. The

               before journal articles. Attention to visual attributes can
               enhance academic poster communication. Objective: This
               investigation's purpose was to create a visual impression
               measurement instrument, and then to describe and compare visual
               impression among scientific posters from an academic conference.
               Methods: A mixed-approach rubric was created to quickly measure
               visual impression of academic posters. Then, posters from a
               pharmacy education conference were retrospectively reviewed and
               scored. Visual impression was compared for traditional versus
               contemporary poster-formats. Various poster characteristics
               (poster-format, summary statement presence, abstract presence,
               wordiness, QR-code presence, logical sequencing, visuals) that
               might have impacted visual communication were coded. These
               characteristics were regressed onto visual impression scores.
               Results: Three-hundred seventy-eight posters were scored with
               sound inter-rater reliability. Contemporary poster-format scored
               significantly higher than traditional. Poster-format, abstract
               absence, lack of wordiness, QR-code presence, logical sequencing,
               and number of visuals were significant when regressed.
               Conclusion: Posters at one academic conference had varied visual
               impression. While a contemporary poster-format appeared more
               helpful, it was not a panacea; variation from poor through
               exemplary was seen with both poster-formats. Posters are not
               text-filled articles; displaying a combination of visuals/text
               clearly and concisely can help effective communication with
               academic posters.",

               pharmacotherapy influences the mortality risk. Objective: To
               investigate whether initiation of ADHD pharmacotherapy was
               associated with reduced mortality risk in individuals with ADHD.
               Design, Setting, and Participants: In an observational nationwide
               cohort study in Sweden applying the target trial emulation
               framework, we identified individuals aged 6 through 64 years with
               an incident diagnosis of ADHD from 2007 through 2018 and no ADHD
               medication dispensation prior to diagnosis. Follow-up started
               from ADHD diagnosis until death, emigration, 2 years after ADHD
               diagnosis, or December 31, 2020, whichever came first. Exposures:
               ADHD medication initiation was defined as dispensing of
               medication within 3 months of diagnosis. Main Outcomes and
               Measures: We assessed all-cause mortality within 2 years of ADHD
               diagnosis, as well as natural-cause (eg, physical conditions) and
               unnatural-cause mortality (eg, unintentional injuries, suicide,
               and accidental poisonings). Results: Of 148 578 individuals with
               ADHD (61 356 females [41.3\%]), 84 204 (56.7\%) initiated ADHD
               medication. The median age at diagnosis was 17.4 years (IQR,
               11.6-29.1 years). The 2-year mortality risk was lower in the
               initiation treatment strategy group (39.1 per 10 000 individuals)
               than in the noninitiation treatment strategy group (48.1 per 10
               000 individuals), with a risk difference of -8.9 per 10 000
               individuals (95\% CI, -17.3 to -0.6). ADHD medication initiation
               was associated with significantly lower rate of all-cause
               mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.79; 95\% CI, 0.70 to 0.88) and
               unnatural-cause mortality (2-year mortality risk, 25.9 per 10 000
               individuals vs 33.3 per 10 000 individuals; risk difference, -7.4
               per 10 000 individuals; 95\% CI, -14.2 to -0.5; HR, 0.75; 95\%
               CI, 0.66 to 0.86), but not natural-cause mortality (2-year
               mortality risk, 13.1 per 10 000 individuals vs 14.7 per 10 000
               individuals; risk difference, -1.6 per 10 000 individuals; 95\%
               CI, -6.4 to 3.2; HR, 0.86; 95\% CI, 0.71 to 1.05). Conclusions
               and Relevance: Among individuals diagnosed with ADHD, medication
               initiation was associated with significantly lower all-cause
               mortality, particularly for death due to unnatural causes.",

               theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to
               personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data.
               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of inductive
               steps that successively lead the researcher from studying
               concrete realities to rendering a conceptual understanding of
               them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney G. Glaser and
               Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop middle-range theories
               from qualitative data. Hence they not only intended to
               conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to demonstrate
               relations between conceptual categories and to specify the
               conditions under which theoretical relationships emerge, change,
               or are maintained.",

               recommendations for shadowing as a method of organizational study
               with a focus on the situated processes and practices of shadowing
               fieldwork. Design/methodology/approach– This paper reflects on
               the shadowing experiences of three researchers – in a hospital
               emergency department, nuclear power plants, and entrepreneur
               workspaces – to generate recommendations by identifying and
               synthesizing solutions that emerged during the encounters with
               the challenges and opportunities in shadowing. Findings–
               Considering shadowing as an ongoing and emergent research process
               can be helpful to prepare for particular aspects of shadowing
               fieldwork. Shadowing presents research challenges that may emerge
               in the practice of fieldwork, including how to negotiate awkward
               conversations with participants, what to bring and wear, and how
               to take notes. Practical implications– Though the recommendations
               for shadowing are based on particular experiences and may not
               generalize to all shadowing engagements, they offer concrete,
               practical recommendations useful across experience levels. The
               recommendations should sensitize researchers to the intimate and
               situational character of shadowing, and offer strategies for
               coping with the distinctive requirements of shadowing.
               Originality/value– By looking across diverse experiences of
               shadowing, the paper generated guidelines that help to make sense
               of shadowing processes, manage uncertainty in the field, and
               build on the emerging work on shadowing. The ten recommendations
               provide insight into shadowing that are of particular value to
               graduate students, junior researchers, and those new to
               shadowing. Moreover, the experienced shadower may find value in
               the camaraderie of shared experience, the concrete ideas about
               another's experience of shadowing, and insight in recommendations
               that capture aspects of fieldwork that they are also exploring.",

                 ensuring the effectiveness of a near-peer shadowing program in
                 the hope of improving the preparedness of students for clinical
                 training. METHOD: A list of 12 tips were developed by combining
                 a review of the literature with a reflection upon the authors'
                 own experiences with developing a near-peer shadowing program,
                 in which first-year medical students shadowed first-year

               to understand the knowledge and learning realities and needs of
               three Chilean construction companies. Based on these results, a
               mobile cloud-shared workspace to support knowledge management was
               developed. Results show that major concerns of users are
               associated with how the system acknowledges the particularities
               of construction projects and how it will be incorporated into
               daily activities. Main conclusions indicate that (1) companies
               acknowledge the need to develop a culture of innovation within
               the organization, (2) users consider the system as a tool that
               could really contribute to improve the construction project
               management process, and (3) the system needs improvements
               regarding database search and the Internet support before being
               fully implemented in the company as a project management tool.",

               little has changed on the shopfloor. This paper examines both
               claims. Much has changed in Britain since 1979. In particular,
               the political role of unions has altered substantially. Unions in
               1991 are infrequently consulted and have very little influence.
               In addition, the legislative framework within which unions
               operate is very different; their activities are much more
               circumscribed by the law than previously. But much less has
               changed on the shopfloor; for example, there is limited evidence
               of a major move to derecognise unions or restrict collective
               bargaining. Governments can only set the legislative framework

              everyday work activities and to identify the conditions that
              enabled learning and employee-driven innovation that contributed
              to production improvement, in small and medium-sized enterprises

              draws on evidence from research conducted in four manufacturing
              SMEs that participated in this Swedish WPDP. Funded by EU
              authorities, WPDPs provide competence development activities to
              SMEs in order to boost their production capabilities and/or
              promote innovation. The findings reveal that the competence
              development activities provided by the programme triggered
              learning in everyday work activities and fostered the development
              of different approaches to employee-driven innovation in the
              enterprises. The conclusion is that it is essential to consider
              that employee-driven innovations may take different forms and
              involve functions that can support innovative learning that goes
              beyond minor adjustments to the existing standards of production.

                 research findings - both quantitative and qualitative - and
                 identifies ten key messages: (1) The starting points are to
                 recognise that: (a) paradigms of learning differ; and (b)
                 workplaces are contested spaces in which what counts as
                 'learning'; (2) Measures of 'learning as acquisition' include
                 the incidence of workplace training; (3) Real levels of
                 training expenditure by employers have also moved downwards;
                 (4) Despite the emphasis placed on training course attendance
                 and the acquisition of qualifications, both are relatively
                 low-rated by employees in terms of their helpfulness in
                 improving work performance; (5) At a time when formal workplace
                 training has been declining, the evidence suggests that the
                 importance of learning on-the-job is rising; (6) All sources of
                 workplace learning from whatever paradigm are skewed towards

               VET research is concerned with exploring continuity as well as

               change and continuity might require a more substantive and

               whether VET researchers are sufficiently concerned with the life
               and practices of contemporary workplaces. The chapter tentatively
               suggests that it is time for some recalibration of the way VET
               research is conceived and organized in order to have a broader
               influence on policy and practice at both a national and

                 framework to describe how the knowledge created and acquired in
                 VET is changing due to technological innovation and the shift
                 towards a knowledge economy. The discussion sets out from the
                 question how vocational or professional knowledge may be
                 distinguished from other forms of knowledge and what
                 philosophical and epistemological traits may underpin this
                 distinction. Building on an analysis of ‘intrinsic’ and
                 ‘extrinsic’ conceptions of knowledge, the paper explores how
                 appropriate descriptors for the classification of theoretical
                 or propositional knowledge as well as practical knowledge may
                 be identified. As a result, a proposal for structuring
                 vocational knowledge is presented. The concluding part
                 addresses the question how the proposed categories may serve to
                 characterise changes in vocational knowledge and explores the
                 requirements for applying the conceptual framework in empirical

               role of small‐ to medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in promoting
               and/or hindering educational opportunities to adult employees in
               the UK.Design/methodology/approach– The paper draws on 12 case
               studies of SMEs in England and Scotland, which form part of a
               larger European Sixth Framework Programme research project.
               Interviews were conducted with employers, line managers and
               employees participating in formal educational programmes, and
               were contextualized with policy documents and literature on
               lifelong learning and workplace education.Findings– This paper
               highlights and explores findings related to human resource
               management (HRM) and the participation of employees in formal
               education, and the experiences of companies in providing
               educational opportunities to employees in England and Scotland.
               The paper argues that employers have a key role to play in
               driving and investing in employee training and development.
               However, the current focus of employers on formal educational
               opportunities appears narrowly focused on job‐specific, in‐house
               training.Originality/value– The paper's value lies in its
               illustration of the restricted focus of the lifelong learning
               policy agenda on the development of human capital, which not only
               limits the development of portable skills and qualifications for
               employees, but also undermines the broader aims of lifelong

               and the learning challenge it presents for individuals,

               the role of knowledge in the economy has been framed in terms of
               Cartesian notions of objective and subjective knowledge and human
               capital notions that the aim of learning is to support people to
               adapt to a pre-given economic reality. The book argues that these

               their conception of the relationship between process and goals in

               that it is the ability of the individual to question through
               experience that is most important for the human community.
               Vygotsky, while recognizing the importance of (especially

               and Vygotsky on three key points that relate directly to
               educational processes and goals. First, the two theorists are
               compared on the role of social history and the tools it produces.
               Dewey sees social history as creating a set of malleable tools
               that are of use in present circumstances. Vygotsky believes that
               tools developed through history have a far more lasting impact on
               the social community. Second, the two theorists are compared in
               their conceptualizations of experience/culture. Dewey sees
               experience as helping to form thinking, whereas Vygotsky, in his
               cultural historical theory, posits culture as the raw material of
               thinking. Third, the two theorists are compared on their
               perspectives on human inquiry. Dewey sees the child as a free
               agent who achieves goals through her own interest in the
               activity. Vygotsky suggests there should be greater control by a
               mentor who creates activity that will lead the child towards
               mastery. These differences are then explored in terms of how they
               might impact actual classroom strategies and curriculum.]",

               brings together a number of cogent subjects under one collective
               ‘umbrella’. Each of these chapters contain original findings, all

               understanding of the wider issues affecting the offsite market,
               from the need to embrace societal challenges, through to the

  author    = "Berger, Thor and Frey, Carl Benedikt",
  publisher = "Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD)",
  abstract  = "In tandem with the diffusion of computer technologies, labour
               markets across the OECD have undergone rapid structural
               transformation. In this paper, we examine i) the impact of
               technological change on labour market outcomes since the computer
               revolution of the 1980s, and ii) recent developments in digital
               technology – including machine learning and robotics – and their
               potential impacts on the future of work. While it is evident that
               the composition of the workforce has shifted dramatically over
               recent decades, in part as a result of technological change, the
               impacts of digitalisation on the future of jobs are far from
               certain. On the one hand, accumulating anecdotal evidence shows
               that the potential scope of automation has expanded beyond
               routine work, making technological change potentially
               increasingly labour-saving: according to recent estimates 47
               percent of US jobs are susceptible to automation over the
               forthcoming decades. On the other hand, there is evidence
               suggesting that digital technologies have not created many new
               jobs to replace old ones: an upper bound estimate is that around
               0.5 percent of the US workforce is employed in digital industries
               that emerged throughout the 2000s. Nevertheless, at first
               approximation, there is no evidence to suggest that the computer
               revolution so far has reduced overall demand for jobs as
               technologically stagnant sectors of the economy – including
               health care, government and personal services – continue to
               create vast employment opportunities. Looking forward, however,
               we argue that as the potential scope of automation is expanding,
               many sectors that have been technologically stagnant in the past
               are likely to become technologically progressive in the future.
               While we should expect a future surge in productivity as a
               result, the question of whether gains from increases in
               productivity will be widely shared depends on policy responses.",

               accountants, architects, the clergy, consultants, lawyers, and
               many others, to work as they did in the 20th century. The Future
               of the Professions explains how increasingly capable technologies
               - from telepresence to artificial intelligence - will place the
               'practical expertise' of the finest specialists at the fingertips
               of everyone, often at no or low cost and without face-to-face
               interaction. The authors challenge the 'grand bargain' - the
               arrangement that grants various monopolies to today's
               professionals. They argue that our current professions are
               antiquated, opaque and no longer affordable, and that the
               expertise of their best is enjoyed only by a few. In their place,
               they propose five new models for producing and distributing
               expertise in society. The book raises profound policy issues, not
               least about employment (they envisage a new generation of
               'open-collared workers') and about control over online expertise
               (they warn of new 'gatekeepers') - in an era when machines become
               more capable than human beings at most tasks. With a new preface
               exploring recent critical developments, this updated edition
               builds on the authors' groundbreaking research into more than a
               dozen professions. Illustrated with numerous examples from each,

               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student’s cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal dimension
               in modeling the student’s knowledge state and cognitive behavior
               is critical, especially in such domains. In this paper, we
               propose an approach for student modeling and diagnosis, which is
               based on a symbiosis between temporal Bayesian networks and
               fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter may help building a
               powerful domain knowledge model and the former may help modeling
               the learner’s complex cognitive behavior, so as to be able to
               provide him or her with relevant feedback during a
               problem-solving process. To illustrate the application of the
               approach, we designed and developed several key components of an
               intelligent learning environment for teaching the concept of

               systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based on
               individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far superior
               to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors are
               ‘intelligent tutors’ because they are able to continously adapt
               the content and style of their instruction to best meet the needs
               of the learner. The historical evolution of intelligent tutoring
               systems is presented. The starting point was programmed
               instruction in the late 1960s, followed by knowledge-based tutors
               that try to simulate good human tutors by the integrated use of
               domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and knowledge about the
               individual student. Finally some important current trends like
               distance learning, collaborative learning, and Web-based learning
               are outlined. The presentation is given within a cognitive
               science point of view. From this perspective the research on

                  in the construction curricula thus bridging the gap between
                  the classroom and the construction site. Enhancements are
                  being accomplished by developing 1) an Internet-based
                  Interactive Construction Management Learning System (ICMLS)
                  and 2) an advising and mentorship program that will enhance
                  practitioner-involvement. The Interactive Learning System uses
                  interactive and adaptive learning environments to train
                  students in the areas of construction methods, equipment and
                  processes. This system is being developed using multimedia;

              UK. The main findings from the survey were that the European VTC
              and UK panelised manufacturers had similarly high productivity and
              the UKVTC manufacturers had potential for growth. The MFP of four
              timber construction projects was then analysed: two low-rise
              residential projects (using open timber panel and VTC), and two
              mid-rise residential developments (one using closed timber panels
              and one using cross laminated timber). The results revealed that
              increased offsite completion in the factory could result in
              increased construction productivity however external and internal
              works were still a major challenge to efficiency. The overall
              analysis was used to outline a theoretical framework for an
              innovative MFP index with five key quantified variables and five
              secondary qualitative variables. This index facilitates the
              measurement and comparison of construction productivity between a
              variety of different structural systems and is one of the unique
              contributions to knowledge generated in this thesis.",

               are common problems in doctoral education. Research shows that
               many different factors are associated with doctoral success, but
               these factors have not often been studied simultaneously.
               Moreover, characteristics of the PhD project are mostly
               neglected. In this study, we investigate which supervision,
               psychosocial, and project characteristics are related to
               satisfaction, progress, and quit intentions in a sample of 839
               PhD candidates at a university in the Netherlands. Results of
               regression analyses show that experienced workload was negatively
               related to satisfaction and progress and positively to quit
               intentions. The quality of the supervisor-PhD candidate
               relationship, the PhD candidate?s sense of belonging, the amount
               of freedom in the project, and working on a project closely

              architect of experiential learning, to fully comprehend its

               different training modalities on increasing workplace learning,
               representatives' intent to transfer what they learned into their
               work, and importantly how training impacts actual work
               performance. These relationships are tested in the context of a
               Chinese division of a multinational pharmaceutical company, where
               pharmaceutical representatives are tasked with relaying relevant
               efficacy and safety information on pharmaceutical products to
               health care professionals who prescribe them to patients.
               Methods: The present study employed a three-group
               between-subjects experimental design. Representatives received
               varying forms of training (instruction only, instruction plus
               reflection, and instruction, reflection, plus direct feedback)
               based on experimental conditions. After three training sessions
               over the course of six weeks, representatives were assessed on
               how much they learned in the training and their actual work
               performance through observer assessment of meetings with health
               care professionals, facilitated by the representatives. Findings:
               In this study, it was found that the process of actively
               reflecting on what was learned in training led to increased
               learning, as well as increased performance, compared to simply
               studying the material. However, receiving direct feedback on
               training performance, combined with active reflection training,
               did not provide any further benefits in terms of learning or work
               performance. Notably, there were no differences in intent to
               transfer learned material to work, as all conditions reported
               high levels of transfer intention. Conclusion: The finding
               provides insightful evidence to support the benefits of fostering
               trainees' active reflections for work-based learning in the
               Chinese industry training scenario. In contrast, receiving direct
               comments on how students performed from a manager or trainer, as
               well as advise on how do better in the future, had no effect on
               increasing learning or performance. Although the effect of direct
               feedback is not statistically significant in this context,
               further research should be done in understanding individuals'
               thoughts and behaviors when received direct feedbacks received in
               workplace training. Relatively little workplace research has
               assessed both workplace learning and performance in the same
               study, specifically in the Chinese context. While training
               efficacy likely varies across cultures to begin with,
               compensation structures in China do not provide the same monetary
               incentives for workplace learning (i.e. chance to increase
               income) as Western culture. This means that any way to increase
               workplace learning should be of extra value, as employees
               otherwise may not engage in it at all.",

               framework also including situation-specific context factors. In a
               second step, three distinct components of human agency as a
               personal feature of individuals are derived and discussed: (a)
               agency competence (i.e. the capacity to visualise desired future
               states, to set goals based on these states, to translate these
               goals into actions, to engage in these actions, and to deal with
               upcoming problems), (b) agency beliefs (i.e. perceptions of
               whether one is agentically competent or not), and (c) agency
               personality (i.e. a stable and comparable situation-unspecific
               inclination to make choices and to engage in actions based on
               these choices with the aim to take control over one’s life or
               environment). In a third step, the results of this theoretical
               discussion are then used to propose an operational definition of
               human agency that may be used in a range of empirical studies
               employing hypothesis-testing methods.",

               respectively. By doing so, the literature has adopted a rather

               The active role of candidates being agentic constructors of their
               academic career has been widely neglected. This study therefore
               focuses on how PhD students can take an active approach towards
               their academic development. A qualitative interview study with
               ten German faculty members was conducted to answer the following
               research questions: (1) How do supervisors conceptualise academic
               success of PhD students? (2) How does professional agency affect
               academic success of young researchers? (3) What individual and/or
               contextual factors affect the exercise of professional agency?
               Based on these interviews, evidence is reported on how doctoral
               candidates can indeed affect their academic development and
               eventually their success by exercising professional agency. Among

               industry-spanning opportunities. However, exploiting these
               opportunities requires a targeted implementation of Industry 4.0.
               The purpose of this paper is to generate a deeper understanding
               of relevant implementation action. Existing recommendations are
               mostly general, highly aggregated and difficult to grasp. Yet,
               specific and concrete actions that need to be taken to accelerate
               the realization of Industry 4.0 are
               essential.Design/methodology/approach The article uses 13
               semi-structured in-depth expert interviews as the source of
               empirical data. The interviews were conducted with managers from
               Industry 4.0-experienced German manufacturing companies. All
               interviews are analyzed using qualitative content
               analysis.Findings The study reveals relevant and targeted aspects
               for Industry 4.0 implementation: the development of Industry
               4.0-specific know-how, securing financial resources, integrating
               employees into the implementation process and establishing an
               open-minded and flexible corporate culture. Further aspects
               include comprehensive planning processes, cooperation with
               external partners, proper handling of data interfaces,
               interdisciplinary communication, an adaptable organizational
               structure and data security.Research limitations/implications The
               paper is limited to German manufacturing enterprises and should

               Industry 4.0 within their organizations and consequently benefit
               from Industry 4.0 and derives recommendations for future
               research.Originality/value The paper is among the first to give

  abstract  = "The effective management of modern complex construction projects
               requires a clear understanding of how the stages and players
               involved interrelate. From the inception of the project onwards,
               information is generated which is then required to be adapted and
               communicated through the various stages to the individuals
               involved so as to complete the project. Of these stages, the
               design has always been recognised as important but, in project
               management terms, not easily managed. The activities involved in
               designing are complex and there is a need to employ the services
               of an increasing number of specialists. This research uses the
               framework developed in Business Process Re-engineering (BPR) to
               establish the existing process involved in developing and
               managing the design. An important element of the building, the
               façade, is used as an example of what happens more generally and
               the research is based on an in-depth case study approach of four
               UK construction projects. To deal with the quantity and quality
               of the qualitative data, the methodology of cognitive mapping is
               used to first create, and then analyse, the perceptions of key
               decision makers involved in the creation and management of the
               design. Using computer based analytical tools the data is
               filtered through a number of stages to produce summaries of the
               process of design. The results of the research identify the need
               for the communication of the key project objectives, together
               with the formation of a strategy for achieving these objectives,
               at the outset. Selection of the right individuals, at the right
               time will significantly increase the development of the team
               approach, which is necessary to successfully develop the design.
               Finally, the use of formalised reviews can ensure that design
               progresses so as to meet the project objectives.",

               integration strategies enable individual projects to break from
               this trap, but much less is known about potential strategic
               action of firms to enable systemic innovation. To explore this, a
               longitudinal comparative case study examines how three
               entrepreneurial firms ? DPR construction, RAD Urban, and Project
               Frog ? in the San Francisco Bay Area describe their own strategic
               evolution and restructuring of firm boundaries over the past five
               years to enable greater adoption of digital manufacturing. Each
               firm has developed a different approach ? relational,
               project-based spinoff; vertical integration; or digital systems
               integration. Benefits and challenges are identified for each. The
               approaches are theorized as a form of strategic mirror-breaking
               intended to redefine the current paradigm of knowledge and task
               dependencies. They enable the firms to develop products with new

               in digitally-enabled manufacturing. The paper concludes with
               discussion of how the identification and characterization of
               strategies for mirror-breaking enriches understanding of
               integration for systemic innovation in construction at the firm

                 construction sector productivity. This decline in such a large
                 sector has had a material effect on secular productivity growth
                 for the economy as a whole. Prior work has focused on the role
                 of potential measurement problems in construction, particularly
                 output deflators in the measurement of productivity. This paper
                 brings some new evidence to bear on the industry’s measured
                 productivity problems and suggests that measurement error is
                 probably not the sole source of the stagnation. First, using
                 measures of physical productivity in housing construction,
                 productivity is falling or, at best, stagnant over multiple
                 decades. Second, there has been a noticeable decline over time
                 in the efficiency with which construction firms translate
                 materials inputs into output, and a corresponding shift toward
                 more value-added-intensive production. Third, using state-level
                 data, we do not find evidence of patterns of within-industry
                 reallocation that might be expected of efficiently operating
                 input and output markets. States with more productive
                 construction sectors do not see growth in their shares of total
                 U.S. construction activity; if anything, their shares fall.

               elites - and how we must reshape the path of innovation to create
               true shared prosperity.A thousand years of history and
               contemporary evidence make one thing clear. Progress is not
               automatic but depends on the choices we make about technology.
               New ways of organizing production and communication can either
               serve the narrow interests of an elite or become the foundation
               for widespread prosperity.Much of the wealth generated by
               agricultural advances during the European Middle Ages was
               captured by the Church and used to build grand cathedrals while
               the peasants starved. The first hundred years of
               industrialization in England delivered stagnant incomes for
               workers, while making a few people very rich. And throughout the
               world today, digital technologies and artificial intelligence
               increase inequality and undermine democracy through excessive
               automation, massive data collection, and intrusive
               surveillance.It doesn't have to be this way. Power and Progress
               demonstrates that the path of technology was once - and can again
               be - brought under control. The tremendous computing advances of
               the last half century can become empowering and democratizing
               tools, but not if all major decisions remain in the hands of a
               few hubristic tech leaders striving to build a society that
               elevates their own power and prestige.With their breakthrough
               economic theory and manifesto for a better society, Acemoglu and
               Johnson provide the understanding and the vision to reshape how
               we innovate and who really gains from technological advances so

              1\% from 2017 and 7\% from 2010. • Increases were driven by strong
              floor area and population expansions. While efficiency
              improvements continued to be made, they were not adequate to
              outpace demand growth. • 2020 is a key year for countries to

               requiring large areas of land for processing, treatment, and
               landfilling. The emerging field of off-site prefabrication and
               assembly is perceived as a viable method to reduce waste and
               improve sustainability. However, there is a lack of quantifiable
               research into the difference between off-site prefabrication and
               on-site, conventional construction for numerous sustainability
               criteria. This paper focuses on modular construction as an
               off-site production system, where a framework to compare waste
               generation of modular and conventional, in-situ construction
               methods is proposed. This paper aims to quantify these
               differences. The framework relies on a comprehensive literature
               review to estimate the waste rates of building materials, which
               are then applied to realistic case studies in order to determine
               the differences in waste generation. Overall, modular
               construction reduces the overall weight of waste by up to 83.2\%,
               for the cases considered. This corresponds to a 47.9\% decrease
               in the cost of waste for large structures. Care must be taken to
               keep modular wastage as low as possible for a reduced cost of
               waste to be also present in smaller structures. This reduces the
               research gap of quantifying the waste differences between
               conventional and modular construction, and provides thoroughly
               researched waste rates for future research, while also improving
               the knowledge of industry stakeholders, informing them of the
               benefits of modular construction. This allows stakeholders to

               examine the latent drivers of relational capability. The main

               (2) show how the adoption of prefabricated housing can be

               effective system integrator.",

               preferred ones. Practices of making futures are increasingly
               online. Yet, as organizational participants come together online
               ? organizing remotely to make offline futures ? they lack the
               shared experiential knowledge that is gained through embodied and
               situated practices. In this essay, we argue that the lack of
               experiential knowledge makes future making online difficult to
               organize and vulnerable to excluding relevant expertise; dialogue
               may become inward-looking and self-referential within the online
               environment, with an emotional and cognitive distance from the
               futures being made outside of such representations. We draw on
               the pragmatist tradition to theorize online future making, to
               articulate its dynamics and the challenges that arise, and to
               suggest remedial actions. By conceptualizing future making as a
               form of inquiry ? as a distributed and reflective process that
               proceeds through engagement with representations of the future ?
               we identify three remedial actions for online future making: to
               solicit feedback, juxtapose alternatives and change medium. These
               remedial actions seek to compensate for the lack of shared
               experiential knowledge by both sustaining the online involvement
               of heterogeneous remote participants and by bringing in relevant

               Prior research highlights the importance of their modularization
               strategies, arguing that firms can either build the competence
               for modularization internally or can source them externally. To
               understand what shapes a firm?s choice to use external
               competences in its modularization strategy, we studied three
               leading construction firms. In this multiple case study, Alpha,
               Beta and Gamma are leaders in Asian markets, using reinforced
               concrete solutions in high-rise industrialized construction.
               Where external competences are available, our analyses show the
               work firms do to make them reliable and that their choice to use
               external competences is shaped by their reliability. Alpha
               modularized in a context with little available external
               competences, so it built new competences in-house; Beta chose to
               use the externally available manufacturing and assembly
               competences, using standards, remote monitoring and control of
               product architectures to make them reliable for their use in
               modularization; Gamma had available competences in the external
               context and initially sought to use them, but reliability
               concerns led to it modularizing by acquiring the firms to bring
               these competences in-house. Our contribution is to show how
               ensuring the reliability of external competences shapes
               modularization strategies. Further, we have identified actions
               that firms can adopt to make external competences reliable
               through: (1) use of international standards, (2) quality control
               procedures, (3) control of product architectures, and 4)
               acquisition of external competences. We provide implications for

                 older workers in the US workplace. Understanding the health and

                 impact of age on injury among workers in the construction
                 industry in terms of cause, type, and cost. PubMed was searched
                 by using the following terms: older workers, construction,
                 construction industry, injury, and age. The available studies
                 reported that, among the construction industry workforce, older
                 age at injury was related to higher injury costs but not to

  abstract  = "\#1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER • Rachel Maddow traces the fight to
               preserve American democracy back to World War II, when a handful
               of committed public servants and brave private citizens thwarted
               far-right plotters trying to steer our nation toward an alliance
               with the Nazis. “A ripping read—well rendered, fast-paced and
               delivered with the same punch and assurance that she brings to a
               broadcast. . . . The parallels to the present day are strong,
               even startling.”—The New York Times (Editors’ Choice)Inspired by
               her research for the hit podcast Ultra, Rachel Maddow charts the
               rise of a wild American strain of authoritarianism that has been
               alive on the far-right edge of our politics for the better part
               of a century. Before and even after our troops had begun fighting
               abroad in World War II, a clandestine network flooded the country
               with disinformation aimed at sapping the strength of the U.S. war
               effort and persuading Americans that our natural alliance was
               with the Axis, not against it. It was a sophisticated and
               shockingly well-funded campaign to undermine democratic
               institutions, promote antisemitism, and destroy citizens’
               confidence in their elected leaders, with the ultimate goal of
               overthrowing the U.S. government and installing authoritarian
               rule. That effort worked—tongue and groove—alongside an
               ultra-right paramilitary movement that stockpiled bombs and
               weapons and trained for mass murder and violent insurrection. At
               the same time, a handful of extraordinary activists and
               journalists were tracking the scheme, exposing it even as it was
               unfolding. In 1941 the U.S. Department of Justice finally made a
               frontal attack, identifying the key plotters, finding their
               backers, and prosecuting dozens in federal court. None of it went
               as planned. While the scheme has been remembered in history—if at
               all—as the work of fringe players, in reality it involved a large
               number of some of the country’s most influential elected
               officials. Their interference in law enforcement efforts against
               the plot is a dark story of the rule of law bending and then
               breaking under the weight of political intimidation. That failure
               of the legal system had consequences. The tentacles of that
               unslain beast have reached forward into our history for decades.
               But the heroic efforts of the activists, journalists,
               prosecutors, and regular citizens who sought to expose the
               insurrectionists also make for a deeply resonant, deeply relevant
               tale in our own disquieting times.",

               effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the effectiveness
               of the students' construction on learning, as well as their
               interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further tested in the
               second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring tactics tutors
               were permitted to use. In order to promote a more interactive
               style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style, tutors were
               suppressed from giving explanations and feedback. Instead, tutors

               (ITSs) tailors direction, support, and feedback to
               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed to
               support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for military
               tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games including Virtual
               Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these game-based desktop
               tutors have also been limited to adaptive instruction for
               cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and decision-making). The
               military requires adaptive instruction to extend beyond the
               desktop to be compatible with the physical nature of many tasks
               performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen. This article examines
               how commercial sensor technologies might be adapted to work with
               GIFT and support tailored computer-guided instruction in the
               psychomotor domain for a military medical training task,
               specifically hemorrhage control. Toward this goal, we evaluated
               the usability and system features of commercial smart glasses and
               pressure-sensing technologies. Smart glasses were selected as the
               focus of this study over handheld mobile devices in order to
               promote a hands-free experience during the training of
               hemorrhage-control tasks on a mannequin. Pressure sensors were
               selected to provide direct measures of effectiveness during the
               application of tourniquets and pressure bandages. Each set of
               technologies (smart glasses and pressure sensors) was evaluated
               not with respect to each other, but with respect to their
               capabilities to support adaptive instruction in the wild at the
               learner?s point-of-need and criteria based on established
               usability heuristics. Instruction in the wild is training
               provided in an environment outside the classroom and areas where
               tracking and sensing infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed
               areas of operation). We examined a wide range of features and
               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
               psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no
               formal training infrastructure is available?",

              quality are well-documented. However, it has not been successfully
              implemented in housing, especially in the affordable housing
              sector. This paper uses the case study method from the affordable
              housing sector to document these challenges and proposes a way
              forward for the sector. Also, findings indicate that the high cost
              of production was identified as a major barrier to the
              proliferation of off-site housing in the UK. However, the research
              found that the effective implementation of processes and practices
              such as Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) could reduce
              the likelihood of cost escalation.",

               abilities exhibit robust gender differences, favoring males. The
               assessment of 3?D spatial skills and associated gender

               accident rates. To prevent accidents, construction workers
               receive occupational safety training and safety instructions.
               However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is
               hardly possible or justifiable in reality. Virtual reality (VR)
               simulations can be a potential solution in this regard by
               allowing workers to experience dangerous situations in a very
               vivid but safe way without being exposed to real hazards. In this

               developed and tested with trainees that learn the safe operation
               of hand-operated power tools. In this particular case study, the
               objective for the participants in the VR simulation was to
               successfully consider all safety aspects in the operation of an

  abstract = "Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM) have
              typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to enhance
              the process of information extraction from building information
              models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of workers'
              tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated the
              effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This research
              aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness of BIM and
              AR system integration to enhance task efficiency through improving
              the information retrieval process during construction. To achieve
              this, a design science research approach was adopted that enabled
              the development and performance of a mobile BIM AR system
              (artefact) with cloud-based storage capabilities to be tested and
              evaluated using a portable desktop experiment. A total of 20
              participants compared existing manual information retrieval
              methods (control group), with information retrieval through the
              artefact (non-control group). The results revealed that the
              participants using the artefact were approximately 50\% faster in
              completing their experiment tasks, and committed less errors, when
              compared to the control group. This research demonstrates that a
              minor modification to existing information formats (2D plans) with
              the inclusion of Quick Response markers can significantly improve
              the information retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration
              has the potential to enhance task efficiency.",

              methods to communicate with students. New technologies have found
              their way into classrooms and have proven to be more effective in
              delivering learning materials to students. Video games have been
              introduced as one of the possible new tools for educating the
              upcoming generation in many different fields. Specifically,
              construction management education has attempted to use simulation
              software to introduce students to various construction concepts.
              However, these simulations have missed the mark when it comes to
              the fun factor which has affected the uptake and therefore the
              educational impact of such tools. CONVEX is an educational video

              construction management concepts without sacrificing enjoyment. A

              to enhance the construction management educational experience. One
              of these new methods is showing real time videos that highlight
              the various elements of concern in the classroom lecture. The
              purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality technology (ART)
              and a layer of artificial visualizations to simulate the
              environmental context and spatio-temporal constraints of various
              construction processes. The superimposition of images serves as an
              instructional mechanism to virtually incorporate jobsite
              experiences into classrooms. This enhancement of spatio-temporal
              constraints enables learners to visualize context and hidden
              processes otherwise unattainable through traditional classroom
              lectures. Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved
              perception of reality is created through the combination of the
              learners’ ability to understand the complexity of construction
              products (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by
              viewing the real environment augmented with computer-generated
              information layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom
              with undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom
              learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they
              combine traditional classroom lectures with ART enabled media.",

              Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and explicates
              the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then

              scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes to supporting
              students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher
              supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across
              various tools and social scaffolds. A discussion of the notion of
              distributed scaffolding is presented, to describe how students in
              classrooms may be supported by various tools and social scaffolds.
              The paper then introduces the kinds of distribution and
              interactions between tools and social scaffolds that need to be
              considered to support multiple students in classroom contexts.
              Finally, distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to
              the key features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer of
              responsibility.",

              development have differing dynamics, the course of development

              of cultural tools (mediational means) upon their users. Vygotsky

               of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest form is
               perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The great
               philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that the
               possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: “A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.” A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: “he could [in any case] not be as strong as a mule.”
               Moral perfection is the third, “the highest degree of excellency
               in man’s character.” Of this perfection Maimonides says: “Imagine
               a person being alone, and having no connection whatever with any
               other person; all his good moral principles are at rest, they are
               not required and give man no perfection whatever. These
               principles are only necessary and useful when man comes in
               contact with others.” “The fourth kind of perfection is the true
               perfection of man; the possession of the highest intellectual
               faculties . . . .” In justification of his assertion, this
               extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges: “Examine the
               first three kinds of perfection; you will find that if you
               possess them, they are not your property, but the property of
               others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is exclusively
               yours; no one else owns any part of it.”",

              employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
              employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates, including
              participation of women and minorities. The article also looks
              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women and
              ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit markedly
              better performance for all groups on rates of attrition and
              completion. Joint programs have developed various innovations,
              including college credit for training and scholarship loans to
              expand apprenticeship and improve quality and retention, although
              there are no quantitative evaluations of the effectiveness of many
              of these specific measures. Research limitations/implications
              Statistical information includes about 65 percent of all
              registered apprentices in the USA. Practical implications The
              paper shows that alternative forms of training sponsorship have
              substantially different effects on enrolment and graduation.
              Identification of the practices, that improve enrolment and
              retention, and their widespread adoption would enhance the
              effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value The dataset
              used in this paper has not yet been used in any publications. The
              findings regarding joint programs are notable, in view of the
              skilled labor shortages facing the construction industry in the

               researchers are increasingly interested in more deeply
               understanding local cultures in the developing regions where they

               Agency is understood as a multifaceted construct describing the
               idea that human beings make choices, act on these choices, and
               thereby exercise influence on their own lives as well as their
               environment. We argue that the concept is discussed from three
               different perspectives in the literature—transformational,
               dispositional, and relational—that are each related to learning
               and development in work contexts. These perspectives do not
               reflect incompatible positions but rather different aspects of
               the same phenomena. The chapter also offers an avenue of insight
               into empirical studies that employ agency as a central concept as
               well as discussions about concepts that closely overlap with
               ideas of human beings as agents of power and influence.",

               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction industry.
               Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic mode and
               interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE device with
               Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the research gaps.
               Finally, an example experiment is provided to demonstrate
               studying hazard identification using eye tracking in construction
               safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from the
               participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan path
               and the 3D heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic
               construction site scenes. This paper provides an approach of
               applying eye tracking to gather more data in virtual environment
               for the future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to
               improve human-computer interaction using eye tracking in the

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design of
              an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two aspects
              of this work have subsequently been used for further research.
              Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its associated
              theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that it could be
              implemented in software. This interpretation has informed further
              research about how one can model context and its impact on
              learning, which has produced a design framework that has been
              successfully applied across a range of educational settings.
              Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The software has
              been adapted into a variety of versions that have supported
              explorations into how to scaffold learners’ metacognition, how to
              scaffold learners’ motivation and the implications of a learner’s
              goal orientation upon their use of the software. The findings from
              these studies have informed our understanding of learner
              scaffolding and have produced consistent results to demonstrate
              the importance of providing learners with appropriately
              challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky’s work is as

              informal, and workplace education. Highly interdisciplinary, it
              builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences, computer
              science, education, and the social sciences. We define learning at
              scale as the study of the technologies, pedagogies, analyses, and
              theories of learning and teaching that take place with a large
              number of learners and a high ratio of learners to facilitators.
              The scale of these environments often changes the very nature of
              the interaction and learning experiences. We identify three types
              of technologies that support scale in education: dedicated
              content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs; dedicated tools, such
              as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and repurposed platforms, such as
              social networks. We further identify five areas that scale
              affects: learners, research and data, adaptation, space and time,
              and pedagogy. Introducing the papers in this special issue on the

              effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
              tutoring. “No tutoring” refers to instruction that teaches the
              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring systems.
              Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or substep-based
              granularities of interaction, whereas most other tutoring systems
              (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have answer-based user
              interfaces. It is widely believed as the granularity of tutoring
              decreases, the effectiveness increases. In particular, when
              compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of answer-based tutoring
              systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and adult human tutors are
              believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0 respectively. This review did
              not confirm these beliefs. Instead, it found that the effect size
              of human tutoring was much lower: d = 0.79. Moreover, the effect
              size of intelligent tutoring systems was 0.76, so they are nearly

               information delivery and enhance higher education practice.
               However, there is limited research on the impact of mobile MR
               (MMR) within construction education and improvement of the
               learners’ experience. With new building information modelling
               (BIM) workflows being adopted within the architecture,
               engineering and construction industry, innovative MMR pedagogical
               delivery methods should be explored to enhance this

               qualitative results derived through thematic analysis of learner
               reflections from two technology-enhanced lessons involving a
               lecture and a hands-on workshop focussed on MMR-BIM delivered
               within postgraduate construction education. Seventy participants
               across the two lessons recruited from an Australian university
               participated to answer the research question: ‘Does applied
               mobile mixed reality create an enhanced learning environment for
               students?’ The results of the analysis suggest that using MMR-BIM
               can result in an enhanced learning environment that facilitates
               unique learning experiences, engagement and motivation. However,
               the study outcome suggests that to understand the processes

               topic is the application of AI in e-learning (AIeL) to improve
               the effectiveness of teaching and learning in precision
               education. This study aims to systematically review publication
               patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals,
               countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a
               co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the
               invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal
               directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total
               of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in follow-up
               studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found that a
               majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and
               applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using
               AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning
               contexts. For field researchers, the visualized network diagram
               serves as a map to explore the invisible relationships among the
               core AIeL research, providing a structural understanding of
               AI-supported research in e-learning contexts. A further
               investigation of the follow-up studies behind the highly co-cited
               links revealed the extended research directions from the AIeL
               mainstreams, such as adaptive learning-based evaluation
               environments. Implications are discussed.",

                 work, it is unclear how many workplace simulations exist and
                 how suitable they are for school-to-work programs. An extensive
                 survey located 142 workplace simulations, many of which were
                 not intended for the school-to-work market. Thirty-nine of the
                 most promising simulations were obtained and analyzed to
                 determine potential problems that might impede their use in
                 school-to-work programs. These simulations were classified
                 according to type (e.g., Skill simulations; Role-Playing
                 simulations; and Strategy simulations) and then critiqued
                 regarding common problems in using them (e.g., usability,
                 learnability, content, and available teacher support). We
                 indicate which problems are most common and what educators can
                 do to overcome them. We close with a propositional analysis of
                 two of the most promising workplace simulations that measures
                 the job-specificity and implicitness of their content. We
                 conclude that simulations can play an important role in
                 school-to-work transition programs, even if not specifically

               Labor shortages are a serious problem for Korea's construction
               industry. The problem is both quantitative and qualitative. There
               is a shortage in supply as due to a decrease in the influx of new
               labor, and existing workers are less productive as they age. The
               problem will only get worse as more and more major public
               projects are being planned. Options for increasing the labor
               supply are somewhat limited, and thus efforts need to be made to
               adopt new technologies that can improve the productivity and
               efficiency of field work and their processes. This paper
               introduces seven innovation technologies that have the best
               potential to increase productivity and thus reduce the burden of
               labor shortage problems. These include 1) Substitution by use of
               robotics and automation, 2) development and applications of
               Innovative materials to reduce on site field work, 3) increase in
               productivity through the implementation of Information
               Technology, 4) improved productivity through the application of
               modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of rework and
               redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating labor
               skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site
               processes.",

               shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the second largest
               employer in the country and according to a Construction Industry
               Institute study 75\% of contractors are experiencing labor
               shortages that are manifesting themselves as cost overruns and/or
               schedule delays. This crisis has been a long time coming and our
               current culture has not helped the problem. Young people who
               don't go to college are seen as ``failures,'' and fewer
               native-born Americans want to work with their hands, outdoors?at
               any wage. In fact a group of high school students surveyed about
               attractive careers listed construction 498th out of 500 possible
               occupations. Not only does construction have an image problem,
               but also the workforce composition of the future is largely
               minority and women, a challenge for an industry that is
               dominantly and traditionally white male. In order to face this
               labor shortage head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill ?
               Change or continue to accept increases in project cost and
               duration. In response to this challenge, several contractors and
               construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
               programs to recruit more individuals to the construction trades,
               including charter schools, community outreach and active
               participation in high school career guidance by apprenticeship
               programs. More construction companies are realizing that
               diversity practices add economic value to their customers. They
               are establishing mentoring programs for minority and women
               contractors and employing consulting firms to assist them in
               acquiring these new cultural competencies. Other firms are
               focusing their efforts on creating a working atmosphere that
               embraces a diverse workforce, complete with worker training on
               how to effectively deal with the changing workplace culture. What
               positive effects are these approaches having on the overall
               problem? Should these individual efforts to improve the image of
               construction and its thrust for diversity be aligned? This paper
               will attempt to highlight the successes that some programs have
               achieved and what new innovations they invoked in their

  abstract  = "The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest challenges
               facing the construction industry. The Construction Users
               Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their workforce
               availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82 percent of
               the respondents reported experiencing work force shortages on
               their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the trend had
               worsened over the previous three years. One promising solution to
               relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to provide adequate
               and effective training. Many research efforts on construction
               worker training have been conducted in the past decade in order
               to address the need and benefits of construction craft training.
               However, a quantitative analysis of construction craft trainings
               benefits and costs from the perspective of worker, project and
               company has rarely been carried out. Providing quantifiable
               analysis regarding the benefits and costs of training can help to
               solve the debate existing in the industry regarding the value of
               craft labor training and improve the effectiveness of craft
               training programs. The research investigated existing major
               datasets relevant with construction craft training developed by
               previous research. Meanwhile, as part of this research, a craft
               director training survey was administrated to measure training
               benefits in productivity, turnover, absenteeism safety and
               rework, as well as information such as core training subjects and
               common barriers for training. The primary objective of the study
               is to qualify the outcomes and effectiveness of strategies for
               construction craft training. Four secondary objectives are
               completed to help achieve the primary goal: (I) Identify the
               major characteristics of construction training and major factors
               affecting construction training; (II) Quantitatively measure the
               outcomes of construction training on the individual and
               project/company level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio models
               based on the survey administrated by the study as well as
               existing industry data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity
               analysis to identify real multiskilling patterns among craft
               workers in order to adopt multiskilling training strategies in
               the construction industry.",

                 previous generation at the same age and are worse off once
                 housing costs are considered. The wage gap between older and
                 younger workers has widened since the 2008 financial crisis and
                 shows no signs of closing. The outlook is uncertain, with young
                 people over-represented in jobs in sectors that are expected to
                 see lower employment growth in the long term, and vital

               membership has declined over 20 percent and three successive
               Conservative governments have enacted labor legislation opposed
               by unions. The author views the government's strongly unfavorable
               treatment of unions as a powerful force, but argues that economic
               and structural changes, such as the growth of temporary and
               part-time workers and the decline of the manufacturing sector,
               are likely to have more lasting adverse effects. Unions are
               adopting various strategies to try to counteract the decline of
               their membership, including innovative organizing methods and
               expanded services for members. The fate of the unions will
               depend, the author concludes, on the success of those strategies,

               responsive to the needs of the labour market and society.
               E-learning has been seen as an effective way of improving the
               quality of teaching and learning in VET schools due to its
               various forms. Nevertheless, there has been some disagreement in
               the litearture on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
               of e-learning in VET. Besides, some studies recently reported a
               decline in enthusiasm about the effects of e-learning in
               companies. In order to closely examine the effects of e-learning
               in VET, we conduct a literature review. We then carry out a
               discussion of the pros and cons with the aim of developing
               suggestions for the better use of e-learning in VET. The results
               of the litearture review show that learners and providers of
               e-learning benefit from it in different ways. In order to
               minimise the risks involved in using e-learning, a mixture of
               online and face-to-face events could be used, and adjusted
               pedagogical concepts should be designed and developed explicitly
               for e-learning.",

               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and the
               extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET system
               serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation. Drawing
               upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and secondary
               data collected in three US cities, the paper argues that the
               focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks the
               emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open the
               prospects for skills and training innovations to meet changing

              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students’ collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in high
              school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA). To
              validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that

              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of

               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters’ spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to develop
               further solutions that encourage further improvement of teaching
               and learning activities for spatial skills.",

               in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates’ position in
               the labour market. The data are from three cohorts of the Dutch
               VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months after graduation.
               The programmes of the highest level—Level 4—of the school-based
               learning route are investigated. To separate narrow from broad
               programmes, a novel criterion is used, based on the argument that
               the match between education and a job within a narrow programme’s
               occupational domain is better than outside that domain and that,
               for a broad programme, such a match does not differ significantly
               between the programme’s domain and outside it. This study shows
               that graduates from narrow education programmes have a less
               favourable labour market position than graduates from broad
               programmes. They have a greater chance of being unemployed and
               are more often mismatched in their jobs, both horizontally and
               vertically. They earn less in any case, particularly if their job
               is outside their occupational domain or below their level. They
               consequently experience worse career opportunities and many are
               more dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this problem, it
               would be better to focus on realising a shift in the influx of
               students from narrow to broad education programmes instead of
               broadening all narrow programmes. Besides this shift to broader
               programmes, offering broad variants of narrow programmes while
               maintaining the narrow, specialist variants could be highly
               allocation efficient.",

               prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
               investment risk. The main downside in the English apprenticeship
               system is that the overall levels of employer engagement and
               training volumes are considered sub-optimal and in reality there
               is a fine balance which can put the performance of the firm and
               the wider economy at risk due to insufficient skill development.
               This paper draws on data from the Net Costs and Benefits of
               Training to Employers series of studies (carried out between 1994
               and 2012). Each of the original studies consisted of case studies
               of employers in particular sectors in which the costs associated
               with training an apprentice were considered against the benefits
               employers obtain through this activity during the training
               period. Data in the original studies was collected in
               face-to-face interviews with the employers. The data were aligned
               with an accounting framework that captured the relevant costs and
               benefits of apprenticeship training from the perspective of the
               employer. Calculations were carried out to also indicate the
               payback period (i.e. the period after training has taken over
               which an employer could be expected to recoup any net cost they
               had incurred). We present the most comprehensive available
               estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to employers in
               England to illustrate how costs vary across sectors and how, for
               most employers, engaging in apprenticeship training leaves them
               with a net cost at the end of the training period. The extent of
               this net cost at the end of the formal training period is found
               to vary substantially by sector and level of apprenticeship and
               over time, in real terms, the net costs of training have tended
               to increase across all sectors. Employers reported a range of
               rationales for training apprentices; from supply-led (e.g. where
               participation was prompted by training providers offering it for
               free) to more demand-led (e.g. where employers saw apprenticeship
               as necessary for acquiring needed skills) reasons. Employer
               sensitivity to various cost parameters depended upon where on the
               supply- to demand-led continuum they fell. Despite various policy
               changes since the mid-1990s, employers’ engagement in
               apprenticeships in England has not achieved a significant volume
               and there are still financial risks attached to investing in this
               form of training. Even with the latest reforms of funding and
               delivery embodied in the move to apprenticeship standards and the
               introduction of an employer levy, there is no guarantee that more
               employers will be willing to train apprentices or that those who
               already engage will train more. There is a need to consider
               various ways of reducing employers’ risk without inducing
               unintended behavioural changes that counter overall policy
               objectives.",

               Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social and pedagogical
               relationships between apprentices and older workers in the
               English steel industry, the article proposes that, building on
               Engeström's work, an ‘expansive’ as opposed to a ‘restrictive’
               approach to apprenticeship will not only deliver the broader

               of apprenticeship and, using data from employee learning logs,

               pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be adequate to
               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life. The
               article concludes by arguing for a definition of vocational
               education and training which is a compound of the four general

              Bohemian Region near the town of Ostrov (Czech Republic),
              archaeologists excavated a structure of a wooden water well lining
              with a square base area of 80 × 80 cm and 140 cm in height. Due to
              the excellent conservation of the oak timbers, studies of
              technological details and precise tree-ring dating were possible.
              The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55 BC, which makes
              this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated archaeological
              wooden construction worldwide. It is the third well from the Early
              Neolithic period that has been discovered in the Czech Republic
              within the last four years. The design consists of grooved corner
              posts with inserted planks. This type of construction reveals
              advanced technical know-how and, till now, is the only known type
              from this region and time period. Thanks to the combination of
              annually resolved and absolutely dated tree-ring widths (TRWs),
              the Czech oak TRW chronology has been significantly extended back
              to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical identification of fragments from the
              well filling show mainly oak (Quercus spp.) and hazel (Corylus
              spp.), indicating a local forest composition dominated by these
              taxa. The shape of the individual structural elements and tool
              marks preserved on their surface confirm sophisticated carpentry
              skills. Based on these observations, we established a model for
              the “chaîne opératoire” from forest utilization to the final
              artefact at the beginning of the Early Neolithic period.",

              references for background information. In view of ongoing global
              activities, a significant rise in production volume within the
              next decade is expected. Prerequisites for the establishment of a
              solid timber construction system using CLT are (1) standards
              comprising the product, testing and design, (2) harmonized
              load-bearing models for calculating CLT properties based on the

              amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
              hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
              construction are of fundamental importance for national and global
              targets to combat climate change. At material level, mitigation
              opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less of the same
              material) and substitution (using a different material). This
              article investigates the latter, with a global focus on the use of
              cross laminated timber to replace concrete floors in steel
              structural systems. This approach, whilst innovative, does not
              require any technological development nor upskilling of current
              professional practice, thus making it an immediately viable
              solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We combine Material Flow
              Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across both spatial and
              temporal dimensions, accounting for different levels of uptake of
              the proposed hybrid construction in the next 30 years. Results
              show that greenhouse gas emissions saving potentials range between
              20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence interval) with an average
              around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full uptake of the hybrid
              construction system by 2050. Our analysis does not account for
              carbon sequestration potential in timber, which would make the
              savings much greater. Still, the overall savings represent a 1.5\%
              reduction of the annual greenhouse gas emissions generally
              attributed to construction, thus making it a non-trivial

  abstract    = "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                 effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                 because their training has not fully prepared them to do so. To
                 address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                 systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                 'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                 learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                 information, to use resources effectively and innovatively, and
                 to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving in
                 practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have developed
                 study designs that use dynamic assessments to measure what
                 trainees have acquired in the past, as well as what they are
                 able to learn in the present. More recently, researchers have
                 also started to emphasise and measure whether and how trainees
                 take action to gain the information they need to learn. Knowing
                 that there are study designs and emerging metrics for assessing
                 PFL, the next question is how to design instruction that helps
                 trainees develop PFL capacities. Although research evidence is
                 still accumulating, the current evidence base suggests training
                 that encourages 'productive failure' through guided discovery
                 learning (i.e. where trainees solve problems and perform tasks
                 without direct instruction, though often with some form of
                 feedback) creates challenging conditions that enhance learning
                 and equip trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS:
                 Preparation for future learning and the associated capacity of
                 being adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                 practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                 assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                 explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in the
                 health care workplace to inform the design of instruction for
                 developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours that
                 relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential sociocultural
                 barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to learn from
                 their daily practice.",

               in a dual apprenticeship system that combines working in a
               company and attending courses at school. Design problems are
               proposed by teachers as a way to address theoretical concepts in
               a practical context. The difficulties encountered by apprentices
               while creating paper based sketches motivated the development of
               a tabletop warehouse simulation providing apprentices with a
               Tangible User Interface in the form of a small-scale model. We
               compare drawings and tangible representational modalities with
               regards to three phases of design problem solving. Tinkering with
               tangibles is described as an easy way to engage into the problem.
               The physical properties of tangibles facilitate the extraction of
               features relevant for verification. The limited expressiveness of
               tangibles allows apprentices to focus on the search for a
               solution rather than on the representation of the problem space.",

               field, however, have inherited a 2D Graphical User Interface

               systems are limited in supporting intuitive interfaces and
               various applications. This paper presents an AR-based tangible
               interaction system for table-top interaction environments. A
               projector displays information or graphical images on the table

               gamification of virtual assembly planning on the user
               performance, user experience and
               engagement.Design/methodology/approach A multi-touch table was
               used to manipulate virtual parts and gamification features were
               integrated into the virtual assembly environment. An experiment
               was conducted in two conditions: a gamified and a non-gamified
               virtual environment. Subjects had to assemble a virtual pump. The
               user performance was evaluated in terms of the number of errors,
               the feasibility of the generated assembly sequence and the user
               feedback.Findings The gamification reduced the number of errors
               and increased the score representing the number of right
               decisions. The results of the subjective and objective analysis
               showed that the number of errors decreased with engagement in the
               gamified assembly. The increase in the overall user experience
               reduced the number of errors. The subjective evaluation showed a
               significant difference between the gamified and the non-gamified
               assembly in terms of the level of engagement, the learning
               usability and the overall experience.Research
               limitations/implications The effective learning retention after
               training has not been tested, and longitudinal studies are
               necessary. The effect of the used gamification elements has been
               evaluated as a whole; further work could isolate the most
               beneficial features and add other elements that might be more
               beneficial for learning.Originality/value The research reported
               in this paper provides valuable insights into the gamification of
               virtual assembly using a low-cost multi-touch interface. The
               results are promising for training operators to assemble a

               is a norm and 3D printing can solve a variety of real-world
               problems. However, in practice, creating models is difficult and
               many end users simply print models created by others. In this
               paper, we explore a specific area of model design that is a
               challenge for end users' measurement. When a model must conform
               to a specific real world goal once printed, it is important that

               errors are a significant (yet often overlooked) challenge for end
               users through a systematic study of the sources and types of
               measurement errors. We argue for a new design

               inaccessible to children with visual impairments. This paper
               presents a set of 3D-printable models designed as building blocks
               for creating movable tactile pictures that can be touched, moved,
               and understood by children with visual impairments. Examples of
               these models are canvases, connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders,
               lifts, walls, and cutouts. They can be used to compose movable
               tactile pictures to convey a range of spatial concepts, such as
               in/out, up/down, and high/low. The design and development of
               these models were informed by three formative studies including
               1) a survey on popular moving mechanisms in children's books and
               3D-printed parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the
               process creating movable tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego,
               Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based prototypes and an
               informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a

               specification, our system can generate a 3D-printable model. We

  abstract = "Literacy is increasingly being thought of as a social practice
              with its use and understandings being context dependent. As an
              essential element within and of education, literacy offers
              possibilities for engaging in everyday life. Health literacy has
              emerged as a means to develop health-promoting practices that has
              meaning in social contexts. Reflecting biomedical interests, the
              focus of health literacy is predominately constructed as a neutral
              and technical process that has specific meaning and practice,
              positioning it as functional literacy. This paper presents one
              approach to critical health literacy based on a multidimension
              (3D) approach with literacy as a situated social practice. The 3D
              model will be described and then the model’s application to health
              literacy will be explored. The use of the 3D model to build
              critical health literacy challenges the biomedical approach to
              health literacy as solely functional literacy. Functional literacy
              is not sufficient for a person to build a critical social
              consciousness and illuminate how social determinates of health
              create inequitable health or how it could be ameliorated. Social
              justice and equity are presented as fundamental prerequisites for
              health. Working with young people in context of schools, the
              reciprocal relationship between health and education offers space
              for possibilities around literacy skills and understanding about
              what creates health. The same space can enable young people to see
              opportunities for empowerment to shape and recreate their social
              reality. Health literacy for social justice and equity, therefore,
              has to include possibilities for understanding and responding to
              sociocultural knowing.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology
                 employed in many research studies. Qualitative and quantitative
                 data generation techniques can be used in a grounded theory
                 study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or construct theory
                 from data, systematically obtained and analysed using
                 comparative analysis. While grounded theory is inherently
                 flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice researchers
                 strive to understand the discourse and the practical
                 application of grounded theory concepts and processes.
                 OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a contemporary
                 research framework suitable to inform a grounded theory study.
                 RESULT: This article provides an overview of grounded theory
                 illustrated through a graphic representation of the processes
                 and methods employed in conducting research using this
                 methodology. The framework is presented as a diagrammatic
                 representation of a research design and acts as a visual guide
                 for the novice grounded theory researcher. DISCUSSION: As
                 grounded theory is not a linear process, the framework
                 illustrates the interplay between the essential grounded theory
                 methods and iterative and comparative actions involved. Each of
                 the essential methods and processes that underpin grounded
                 theory are defined in this article. CONCLUSION: Rather than an
                 engagement in philosophical discussion or a debate of the
                 different genres that can be used in grounded theory, this
                 article illustrates how a framework for a research study design
                 can be used to guide and inform the novice nurse researcher
                 undertaking a study using grounded theory. Research findings
                 and recommendations can contribute to policy or knowledge
                 development, service provision and can reform thinking to
                 initiate change in the substantive area of inquiry.",

                 was charged with examining the state of journal article
                 reporting standards as they applied to qualitative research and
                 with generating recommendations for standards that would be
                 appropriate for a wide range of methods within the discipline
                 of psychology. These standards describe what should be included
                 in a research report to enable and facilitate the review
                 process. This publication marks a historical moment-the first
                 inclusion of qualitative research in APA Style, which is the
                 basis of both the Publication Manual of the American
                 Psychological Association (APA, 2010) and APA Style CENTRAL, an
                 online program to support APA Style. In addition to the general
                 JARS-Qual guidelines, the Working Group has developed standards
                 for both qualitative meta-analysis and mixed methods research.
                 The reporting standards were developed for psychological
                 qualitative research but may hold utility for a broad range of
                 social sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions,
                 methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed
                 of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods,
                 research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article,
                 they present these standards and their rationale, and they
                 detail the ways that the standards differ from the quantitative
                 research reporting standards. They describe how the standards
                 can be used by authors in the process of writing qualitative
                 research for submission as well as by reviewers and editors in
                 the process of reviewing research. (PsycINFO Database Record",

               seem to be hitting at a breakneck pace. In 2022, the world

               renewable sources make up a growing fraction of the energy

               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant and
               pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in frustration
               and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can cause bad VR
               execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack of
               understanding human perception, interaction, design principles,
               and real users. This book focuses on the human elements of VR,
               such as how users perceive and intuitively interact with various
               forms of reality, causes of VR sickness, creating useful and
               pleasing content, and how to design and iterate upon effective VR
               applications. This book is not just for VR designers, it is for
               managers, programmers, artists, psychologists, engineers,
               students, educators, and user experience professionals. It is for
               the entire VR team, as everyone contributing should understand at
               least the basics of the many aspects of VR design. The industry
               is rapidly evolving, and The VR Book stresses the importance of
               building prototypes, gathering feedback, and using adjustable
               processes to efficiently iterate towards success. It contains

                 using 360° videos to present small segments of lecture content
                 for IT students in an Australian University. The aim of this
                 study was to understand; what is the impact of incorporating
                 360° videos into class content for students and teaching staff?
                 In this study the 360° videos are described as “learning
                 atoms”. Learning atoms are short duration videos (1 to 5
                 minutes) captured in 360°. Background: Within this paper we
                 conducted experiments in the classroom using 360° videos to
                 determine if they have an impact on student's feeling of
                 presence with class content. Additionally, to follow up, how
                 does the inclusion of 360° impact on the teaching experience.
                 Methodology: The methodology used in this study focused on both
                 quantitative and qualita-tive aspects. Data was captured at the
                 same time during the teaching period to address the research
                 questions. In order to gauge the feeling of presence within the
                 classroom a short survey was administered to students in the
                 undergraduate IT class at the start (pre) and end (post) of the
                 semester using the same questions to measure any change.
                 Contribution: The main contributions from this study were that
                 we demonstrated there is a potential for providing an
                 alternative ‘immersive’ content presentation for students. This
                 alternative content took the form of 360° learning atoms,
                 whereas further showed our nuance process for creating and
                 publishing of these atoms. Findings: The results show that for
                 students, learning atoms can help improve the sense of
                 presence, particularly for remote students, however the
                 interactive experience can take student’s attention away from
                 the lecturer. The results present potential for providing an
                 alternative ‘immersive’ content presentation for students,
                 however problems for uptake are present for both students and
                 teachers, such as image capture quality and file size Impact on
                 Society: We foresee this approach as being a new approach to
                 teaching students in higher education within online spaces to
                 increase engagement and move towards having a richer virtual
                 experience no matter the location. Future Research: Future
                 research will be conducted to resolve whether presence and
                 engagement is supported by the inclusion of 360° videos in the
                 classroom.",

  abstract = "In a construction project, cranes are usually involved in the
              mobilization of materials and equipment. Therefore, a well-planned
              crane movement on a construction job site increases the efficiency
              of construction operations. This is especially the case when a
              crane is being operated from the material storage place to the
              workspace in a highway construction project, because the time
              allowed for such movement is typically tight, as constrained by
              the vehicular traffic on the highway. To explore the use of
              construction simulation in facilitating people?s understanding of
              construction processes, this paper presents a crane movement
              simulation from the site storage location to the beam erection
              location in a highway construction project on the Interstate 94.
              This simulation was modeled in the Unity 3D game engine and
              visualized in a CAVE virtual reality environment. CAVE is an
              immersive virtual reality environment where projections according
              to different view angles of a scene are projected onto different
              walls of a space. The purpose of this simulation is to help people
              plan crane routes during the construction planning phase. The
              objectives of planning the crane routes are minimizing crane trip
              length and trip time so as to minimize interruptions to the
              highway traffic, save construction costs, and achieve more
              sustainable construction operations. The simulation was tried by
              72 volunteers. A survey of these volunteers showed that 95\% of
              them understood crane operations after trying the simulation,
              compared to 35\% before trying the simulation, and 80\% of the
              responses agreed that such simulation helps people conduct
              construction planning.",

  abstract  = "Purpose Apprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the published
               research on apprenticeship training that is specifically focused
               on the construction sector, to determine the current status quo
               and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approach A systematic review approach
               was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using SCOPUS
               databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified and
               analysed.Findings It was found that monitoring and control is the
               most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth of
               studies that has focused on apprentices training in developing
               countries.Research limitations/implications The gaps identified
               in the current knowledge on apprenticeship training would serve
               as a justification for future investigations. However, the scope
               of the review is limited to papers published in academic journals
               and citable through SCOPUS.Practical implications The outcomes of
               the study provide researchers and other relevant stakeholders
               with a concise report on the findings of previous studies. It
               also provides insight into strategies for improving the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training in the construction
               sector.Originality/value A systematic evaluation of the extant
               literature draws on theoretical evidence and highlights the
               factors that are more likely to influence the outcomes of
               apprentice training for craftspeople in the construction sector.",

               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
               of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
               most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
               required for expert practice in fields from painting and
               sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
               while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
               differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
               are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
               a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
               and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
               uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
               target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
               practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
               meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
               learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
               context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
               serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
               students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
               implications through a proposal for the retooling of
               apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
               skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
               cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
               problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
               reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
               is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
               believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
               pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
               features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
               what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
               we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
               ``success models,'' which we believe exemplify aspects of
               apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
               skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
               to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
               the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
               metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
               section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
               characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
               for the design of learning environments, where ``environment''
               includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
               employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
               sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
               apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
               apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
               designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
               materials, and technologies.",

               instrumental problem-solving approach. The findings demonstrated

               reflecting-in-action and reflecting-on-action as a means to
               develop expertise. The presence of experienced educators

               Research: Crossing Popper with Marcuse",

  abstract  = "This article seeks to propose a rationale for exploratory
               research in the social sciences. Inspired by the recent debates
               around qualitative methods (Gerring, 2001; George and Bennett,
               2005; Brady and Collier, 2004; Mahoney and Rueschemeyer, 2003;
               Ragin, 2008; to name just a few), I seek to demonstrate that
               exploratory research also has a rightful place within the social
               sciences. In order to live up to its potential, exploratory
               research needs to be conducted in a transparent, honest, and
               selfreflexive way – and follow a set of guidelines that ensure
               its reliability. Exploratory research, if conducted in such a
               way, can achieve great validity and it can provide new and
               innovative ways to analyze reality. In most cases, exploration
               demands more from the researcher than confirmatory research, both
               in terms of preparation, as well as in terms of willingness and
               ability to expose oneself to foreign cultures and languages as
               well as the courage to engage in a critical and honest
               selfreflection and critique. It also requires intellectual
               engagement with the topic at stake far beyond the needs of those
               running regressions from their office computers. However,
               exploratory research normally demands less money to conduct, as
               most projects can be done by one researcher alone, without the
               need to mobilize, train, and pay, large research apparatuses.
               Given the disciplinary power of elite scholars and academic
               institutions when it comes to selecting research through funding
               and hiring, exploratory research thus has great emancipatory
               potential, because it can escape the disciplinary power of senior
               “peers” and mainstream funding agencies. To legitimize and
               provide a solid epistemological ground for exploratory research
               in the social sciences, it needs to be grounded in a philosophy
               of science; it has to be articulated within an epistemological
               framework; and it has to formulate a comprehensive methodological
               framework that justifies its methods. Thought also needs to be
               given to the ontology of the social sciences, as decisions about
               what counts as real and what we shall accept as a fact
               necessarily impact our strategy of inquiry.",

              have emerged as key concepts in safety management which promise a
              move away from bureaucracy and a means to manage safety without
              sacrificing performance. However, attempts to apply these ideas
              outside the ultra-safe sectors within which they developed have so
              far been limited. This paper uses the construction industry as a
              test case to explore the applicability of HRO and RE in a less
              highly regulated context. Through this discussion the research
              gaps are highlighted which have prevented the expansion of these
              new approaches into new sectors. The project-based nature,
              transient workforce, widespread outsourcing of labour and
              financial pressure of the construction sector limit opportunities
              for investment in employees and learning from experience; hence,
              developing principles advocated by HRO and RE such as management
              commitment, sensitivity to the frontline, prioritisation of
              safety, empowerment of employees, and a just culture presents a
              significant challenge. In spite of these barriers, there are also
              opportunities to be considered for construction to incorporate
              aspects of HRO and RE at an employee-centred level rather than
              organisational: Aspects of mindfulness and imagination; RE’s
              progressive understanding of accidents; and its holistic approach
              to cultivating resilience. It is argued that these opportunities
              offer a useful perspective for reframing safety debates in
              construction. The paper concludes with a research agenda which
              puts forward the need to extend and adapt aspects of HRO and RE in
              order to tackle some of the key characteristics of construction,
              namely subcontractor networks and temporary projects.",

                 in many species. However, auditory maps of space have not been
                 reported in the primate brain. Instead, recent studies have
                 suggested that sound location may be encoded via broadly
                 responsive neurons whose firing rates vary roughly
                 proportionately with sound azimuth. Within frontal space, maps
                 and such rate codes involve different response patterns at the
                 level of individual neurons. Maps consist of neurons exhibiting
                 circumscribed receptive fields, whereas rate codes involve
                 open-ended response patterns that peak in the periphery. This
                 coding format discrepancy therefore poses a potential problem
                 for brain regions responsible for representing both visual and
                 auditory information. Here, we investigated the coding of
                 auditory space in the primate superior colliculus(SC), a
                 structure known to contain visual and oculomotor maps for
                 guiding saccades. We report that, for visual stimuli, neurons
                 showed circumscribed receptive fields consistent with a map,
                 but for auditory stimuli, they had open-ended response patterns
                 consistent with a rate or level-of-activity code for location.
                 The discrepant response patterns were not segregated into
                 different neural populations but occurred in the same neurons.
                 We show that a read-out algorithm in which the site and level
                 of SC activity both contribute to the computation of stimulus
                 location is successful at evaluating the discrepant visual and
                 auditory codes, and can account for subtle but systematic
                 differences in the accuracy of auditory compared to visual
                 saccades. This suggests that a given population of neurons can
                 use different codes to support appropriate multimodal behavior.",

                 physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual
                 interpretations (``percepts'') that alternate over time.
                 Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive,
                 suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies
                 changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to
                 address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we
                 introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil
                 dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a
                 continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a
                 gradual subjective report. We find that the ``reflexes''
                 reflect the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both
                 reflexes show a gradual dependence on the time relative to
                 perceptual transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick
                 deflections, which are highly correlated with the reflex
                 measures, indicate gradual transitions. Physically simulating
                 wave-like transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal
                 rivalry (i.e., different regions of space belonging to distinct
                 percepts) as one possible explanation for the gradual
                 transitions. Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance
                 durations depend on whether or not the percept is actively
                 reported. In addition, reflexes respond to transitions with
                 shorter latencies than the subjective report and show an
                 abundance of short dominance durations. This failure to report
                 fast changes in dominance may result from limited access of
                 introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal that
                 rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is modulated
                 by the required action (response mode), and that rapid
                 transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from
                 awareness.",

              medicine and the empirical evidence available. This theory
              describes expertise development as the progression through a
              series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized by
              functionally different knowledge structures underlying
              performance. The first phase is characterized by the accumulation
              of causal knowledge about disease and its consequences. Through
              experience with real cases, this knowledge transforms into
              narrative structures called illness scripts. The cognitive
              mechanisms responsible for this transition are: Encapsulation of
              elaborated knowledge into high level but simplified causal models
              or even diagnostic categories and tuning through the inclusion of
              contextual information. The third phase is characterized by the
              use of episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of
              new cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
              phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
              These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any more
              in subsequent phases in the development of expertise, remain
              available for use when ontologically more recently acquired
              structures fail to produce an adequate representation of a
              clinical problem.",

               research. It outlines what is taken to be the conventional view
               in many methodological discussions, namely, that research
               questions guide decisions about research design and research
               methods. This position is taken to imply that social researchers
               typically take the view that research methods need to be tailored
               to the research questions that guide an investigation. The paper
               questions how far this position pertains to actual research
               practice. Drawing on interviews with researchers about their
               practices in relation to mixed?method research, two discourses
               were found in the transcripts. A particularistic discourse that
               reflects the traditional view, whereby mixed?method research is
               viewed as only appropriate when research questions warrant it,
               was uncovered. In addition, a universalistic discourse, which
               sees mixed?method research as more generally superior, was also
               uncovered. The implications of these viewpoints for understanding
               the role of research questions are then discussed.",

  abstract    = "Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy,
                 perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, cognitive
                 psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During the next 20
                 years, grounded cognition continued developing in these areas,
                 and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive ecology,
                 cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology. In the
                 past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown
                 rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social
                 neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and
                 developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition appears
                 to be achieving increased acceptance throughout cognitive
                 science, shifting from relatively minor status to increasing
                 importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder whether grounded
                 mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive system or are
                 peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms. Although grounded
                 cognition is currently dominated by demonstration experiments
                 in the absence of well-developed theories, the area is likely
                 to become increasingly theory driven over the next 30 years.
                 Another likely development is the increased incorporation of
                 grounding mechanisms into cognitive architectures and into
                 accounts of classic cognitive phenomena. As this incorporation
                 occurs, much functionality of these architectures and phenomena
                 is likely to remain, along with many original mechanisms.
                 Future theories of grounded cognition are likely to be heavily
                 influenced by both cognitive neuroscience and social
                 neuroscience, and also by developmental science and robotics.
                 Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive
                 science-classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical
                 systems, and grounded cognition-will probably be integrated
                 increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable

                 strategy. Other studies do not speak of strategies, but of
                 holistic or piecemeal processes or even of holistic or
                 piecemeal rotation. The methodological approach used here is to
                 identify mental-rotation strategies via gaze patterns derived
                 from eye-tracking data when solving chronometric
                 mental-rotation tasks with gender-stereotyped objects. The
                 mental-rotation test consists of 3 male-stereotyped objects
                 (locomotive, hammer, wrench) and 3 femalestereotyped objects
                 (pram, hand mirror, brush) rotated at eight different angles.

               inducing effective pedagogical policies for various interactive
               e-learning environments. However, it is often prohibitive to
               identify the critical pedagogical decisions that actually
               contribute to desirable learning outcomes. In this work, by
               utilizing the RL framework we defined critical decisions to be

               and subsequently, the Critical policy as carrying out optimal
               actions in the critical states while acting randomly in others.
               We proposed a general Critical-RL framework for identifying
               critical decisions and inducing a Critical policy. The
               effectiveness of our Critical-RL framework is empirically
               evaluated from two perspectives: whether optimal actions must be
               carried out in critical states (the necessary hypothesis) and
               whether only carrying out optimal actions in critical states is
               as effective as a fully-executed RL policy (the sufficient
               hypothesis). Our results confirmed both hypotheses.",

               that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three specific behaviors
               (i.e., socialization, externalization, and internalization) and
               they are influenced by four antecedents (trust, self-efficacy,
               knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A survey was conducted to
               collect data from 258 knowledge workers who worked on complex
               product development projects. Structural equation modeling was
               used to analyze the data. The results demonstrate that trust,
               self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support significantly
               affect the externalization and internalization behaviors, and
               trust and IT support significantly affect the socialization
               behavior. This study is helpful to organizations where it is
               critical for employees to share tacit knowledge. It suggests that
               tacit knowledge is difficult to share and organizations should
               nurture mutual trust between employees, enhance their
               self-efficacy, and provide sufficient IT support so that they are
               more likely to engage in tacit knowledge sharing.",

              occur on an annual basis, better training techniques are examined.
              Virtual reality is examined as a way to enhance current training
              practices that consist mainly of slide show presentations and

              is given tasks to complete within the virtual environment similar
              to tasks a worker would have to complete on a day to day basis.
              The purpose of the program is to be a method of rapidly training
              younger miners while supplementing on-the-job training practices
              and ultimately reduce accidents. The model was developed using CAD

               knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between
               tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature
               tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions,
               whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or the
               process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first principles
               shows that knowledge has different degrees of validity, is highly
               heterogeneous and has complicated temporal and social aspects. A
               model of knowledge based on these aspects is presented. Comparing
               the four dimensions of knowledge with knowledge as a process
               opens up a more holistic view of knowledge management and helps
               articulate some of the key differences within streams of research
               in the field. This holistic perspective is also compatible with
               Polanyi's original complex conception of tacit knowledge, which
               drew heavily on Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the
               perception of ``wholes''. The dual perspectives of a
               multi-dimensional conception of knowledge as a commodity and a
               holistic perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues
               of potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge

               than we can tell.'' Many researchers in the knowledge management
               community have used the idea of tacit knowledge to draw a
               distinction between that which cannot be formally represented
               (tacit knowledge) and knowledge which can be so represented

               management researchers give to tacit knowledge hinders
               potentially fruitful work for two important reasons. First, the
               inability to explicate knowledge does not imply that the
               knowledge cannot be formally represented. Second, assuming the
               inability to formalize tacit knowledge as it exists in the minds
               of people does not exclude the possibility that computer systems
               might perform the same tasks using alternative representations.
               By reviewing work from artificial intelligence, I will argue that
               a richer model of cognition and knowledge representation is

                 took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality scenario

                 an unexplored methodology to instigate positive behavioral
                 change among clinicians where other methods have been
                 unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial stewardship. There are
                 several arguments in favor of use of virtual reality in medical
                 education: it can be used for ``difficult to simulate''
                 scenarios and to standardize a scenario, for example, for use
                 in exams. However, there are limitations to its usefulness
                 because of the cost implications and the lack of evidence that
                 it results in demonstrable behavior change.",

               human users who cooperate with machines, both to learn the tasks
               and to perform them. In this paper, we examine workplace learning
               in Materials Recovery Facilities (MRFs), i.e., recycling plants,
               where workers separate waste items on conveyer belts before they
               are formed into bales and reprocessed. Using a simulated MRF, we
               explored the benefit of machine learning assistants (MLAs) that
               help workers, and help train them, to sort objects efficiently by
               providing automated perceptual guidance. In a randomized
               experiment (n = 140), we found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse
               than no MLA at all, both in terms of task performance and
               learning. (2) A perfect MLA led to the best task performance, but
               was no better in helping users to learn than having no MLA at
               all. (3) Users tend to follow the MLA’s judgments too often, even
               when they were incorrect. Finally, (4) we devised a novel
               learning analytics algorithm to assess the worker’s accuracy,

                 metacognitive, behavioral, motivational, and
                 emotional/affective aspects of learning. It is, therefore, an
                 extraordinary umbrella under which a considerable number of
                 variables that influence learning (e.g., self-efficacy,
                 volition, cognitive strategies) are studied within a
                 comprehensive and holistic approach. For that reason, SRL has
                 become one of the most important areas of research within
                 educational psychology. In this paper, six models of SRL are
                 analyzed and compared; that is, Zimmerman; Boekaerts; Winne and
                 Hadwin; Pintrich; Efklides; and Hadwin, Järvelä and Miller.
                 First, each model is explored in detail in the following
                 aspects: (a) history and development, (b) description of the
                 model (including the model figures), (c) empirical support, and
                 (d) instruments constructed based on the model. Then, the
                 models are compared in a number of aspects: (a) citations, (b)
                 phases and subprocesses, (c) how they conceptualize
                 (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion, (d)
                 top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In the
                 discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                 meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                 extracted. Further, four future lines of research are proposed.
                 The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the SRL models
                 form an integrative and coherent framework from which to
                 conduct research and on which students can be taught to be more
                 strategic and successful. Second, based on the available
                 meta-analytic evidence, there are differential effects of SRL
                 models in light of differences in students' developmental
                 stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and teachers need
                 to start applying these differential effects of the SRL models
                 and theories to enhance students' learning and SRL skills.",

                 experiences for engineering students. However, such
                 practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                 allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring the
                 job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed to
                 investigate how job demands, job control, and social support
                 affect interns' use of different learning strategies. Method
                 The study utilized data collected from a sample of engineering
                 students (n =?118) who completed a required internship during
                 their degree. The data were analyzed using a structural
                 equation modeling approach including latent factors. Results
                 Job demands were found to be a relevant and significant driver
                 of students' shared regulation (e.g., asking for feedback),
                 self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use of codified
                 information), efforts to relate theory to practice (e.g.,
                 connecting workplace experience with theoretical knowledge),
                 and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g., lack of
                 adaptation to work situations), but not of external regulation
                 (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job control,
                 however, was not found to be a positive or significant driver
                 of student learning. Social support was found to be a relevant
                 and significant predictor of external and shared regulation but
                 not of the other learning activities. Conclusions This study
                 provided mixed findings regarding key hypotheses central to the
                 JDCS model, generating rather poor evidence supporting it. In
                 fact, job demands, job control, and social support exhibited
                 much less explanatory power than expected for engineering
                 students' learning during internships.",

               existing construction worker education and training environments.

              be attributed to intrinsic knowledge-independent properties of the
              medium in which images are instantiated or the mechanisms by which
              they are processed; or (b) whether images are typically

              simulation of the act of witnessing certain real events taking
              place and therefore use their tacit knowledge of the imaged
              situation to cause the transformation to proceed as they believe
              it would have proceeded in reality. The tacit knowledge account is

                 in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science,
                 there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is
                 tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the
                 arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision,
                 neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other
                 areas of vision science) and defends the position that an
                 important part of visual perception, corresponding to what some
                 people have called early vision, is prohibited from accessing
                 relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in determining
                 the function it computes--in other words, it is cognitively
                 impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and involves
                 top-down interactions that are internal to the early vision
                 system. Its function is to provide a structured representation
                 of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to serve as an index
                 into memory, with somewhat different outputs being made
                 available to other systems such as those dealing with motor
                 control. The paper also addresses certain conceptual and
                 methodological issues raised by this claim, such as whether
                 signal detection theory and event-related potentials can be
                 used to assess cognitive penetration of vision. A distinction
                 is made among several stages in visual processing, including,
                 in addition to the inflexible early-vision stage, a
                 pre-perceptual attention-allocation stage and a post-perceptual
                 evaluation, selection, and inference stage, which accesses
                 long-term memory. These two stages provide the primary ways in
                 which cognition can affect the outcome of visual perception.
                 The paper discusses arguments from computer vision and
                 psychology showing that vision is ``intelligent'' and involves
                 elements of ``problem solving.'' The cases of apparently
                 intelligent interpretation sometimes cited in support of this
                 claim do not show cognitive penetration; rather, they show that
                 certain natural constraints on interpretation, concerned
                 primarily with optical and geometrical properties of the world,
                 have been compiled into the visual system. The paper also
                 examines a number of examples where instructions and ``hints''
                 are alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is
                 concluded that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the
                 view that when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus
                 outside early vision, in such processes as the allocation of
                 focal attention and the identification of the stimulus.",

                 simulation technology in emergency medicine education and
                 training, in particular for training nontechnical skills.
                 Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR with
                 traditional training media often demonstrate the equivalence or
                 even superiority regarding particular variables of learning or
                 training effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: In the EPICSAVE (Enhanced
                 Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious Games and Virtual
                 Environments) project, a highly immersive room-scaled
                 multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment was
                 developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain initial
                 insights into the training effectiveness and media use factors
                 influencing learning and training in VR. METHODS: The virtual
                 emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with shock,
                 swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as well as
                 skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient) visiting
                 an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather (virtual
                 agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and posttest
                 design was used to evaluate the training effectiveness and
                 quality of the training execution. The sample included 18
                 active emergency physicians. RESULTS: The 18 participants rated
                 the VR simulation training positive in terms of training
                 effectiveness and quality of the training execution. A strong,
                 significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01) between experiencing
                 presence and assessing training effectiveness was observed.
                 Perceived limitations in usability and a relatively high
                 extraneous cognitive load reduced this positive effect.
                 CONCLUSIONS: The training within the virtual simulation
                 environment was rated as an effective educational approach.
                 Specific media use factors appear to modulate training
                 effectiveness (ie, improvement through ``experience of
                 presence'' or reduction through perceived limitations in
                 usability). These factors should be specific targets in the
                 further development of this VR simulation training.",

               offer well-known approaches for establishing safe work practices,
               serious games in virtual reality (VR) are used more often as a
               complementary approach for active, personalized learning

               trainees can potentially manipulate and interact with virtual

               focused on generating and analyzing the inherent data that can be
               collected about the trainees’ actions in the virtual environment.
               The objective analysis of their performance in the virtual

  abstract  = "The idea of creating intelligent machines and artificial
               intelligence (AI) have been around for centuries, and can be
               traced back to at least to the 14 th century. Artificial
               Intelligence in Education (AIED) is a much younger discipline,
               but during the last 25 years there have been achievements in a
               number of fields which have made impact on education. Critical
               voices have been raised against the over-optimism in contemporary
               AI research. Less have been written about the high expectation of
               AIED and its potential impact on education. The aim of this study
               was to analyse and discuss AIED from the teacher perspective.
               This study was carried out as a SWOT-analysis, with data gathered
               from a literature study. Main keywords in the literature search
               were: artificial intelligence, artificial intelligence in
               education, AIED, teacher perspective, education and teacher.
               Themes and patterns in the four main categories where further
               processed as a deductive-inductive thematic analysis. Findings
               indicates that there are both promises and threats for the
               teacher in the contemporary AIED. In several aspects the field
               seems to be in a state of hype but as other hype areas there is a
               potential for maturing and with concrete applications in daily
               teaching and learning activities. Recommendations is to learn
               from traditional AI and to open up for an informative and nuanced
               discussion concerning the role of AI in education. Otherwise
               there is a risk for artificial education instead of artificial
               intelligence in education.",

                 self-practice of the ABCDE approach (Airways, Breathing,
                 Circulation, Disability, Exposure) in an immersive and
                 interactive virtual reality (VR) application gave non-inferior
                 learning outcome compared to using traditional equipment (TP)
                 in first year medical and nursing students. METHODS: A
                 non-inferior parallel group randomized controlled trial. The
                 study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in
                 August and September 2019. All students participated in a
                 15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced
                 the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and
                 interactive VR application using hand controllers with some
                 haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge,
                 ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary
                 outcome was the number of students who documented all the eight
                 predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the correct
                 order in a practical test on an advanced simulator manikin with
                 a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the
                 self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit
                 was 13\% points. RESULTS: Of all eligible students, 84\%
                 participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n =
                 149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed
                 non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8\% in individual
                 VR doing all observations in correct order compared to 27.1\%
                 TP (absolute difference 2.3\% points, one sided 95\% CI 2.3 to
                 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between the groups,
                 but more students in VR reported liking the way they practiced
                 (absolute difference 46\% points, 95\% CI 36.5 to 56.6) and
                 that it was a good way to learn (36.9\% points, 95\% CI 26.8 to
                 47). VR also scored high on the System Usability Scale (mean
                 difference 6.4\% points, 95\% CI 2.8-10.1). CONCLUSIONS:
                 Individual self-practicing the ABCDE approach in VR was
                 non-inferior to individual self-practicing with traditional
                 equipment.",

               games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12 or higher education

               games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of games, and 27
               studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual worlds were
               meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that the study
               came from K-12 or higher education settings, used experimental or
               quasi-experimental research designs, and used a learning outcome
               measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual reality-based
               instruction.Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM = 0.51),
               simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual worlds (FEM =
               0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving learning outcome
               gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect sizes was
               statistically significant, indicating that the studies were
               different from each other. Therefore, we conducted moderator
               analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies. Key
               findings included that: games show higher learning gains than
               simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies, elaborate
               explanation type feedback is more suitable for declarative tasks
               whereas knowledge of correct response is more appropriate for
               procedural tasks. Students performance is enhanced when they
               conduct the game play individually than in a group. In addition,
               we found an inverse relationship between number of treatment
               sessions learning gains for games.With regards to the virtual
               world, we found that if students were repeatedly measured it
               deteriorates their learning outcome gains. We discuss results to
               highlight the importance of considering instructional design

               methodology: focusing attention on what occurs as interlocutors
               move among settings and situations. Whereas ethnographers often
               zoom in on one principal set of situations or site, we argue that
               intersituational variation broadens and deepens the researcher?s
               ethnographic account as well as affording important correctives
               to some common inferential pitfalls. We provide four warrants for
               shadowing: (a) buttressing intersituational claims, (b) deepening
               ethnographers? ability to trace meaning making by showing how
               meanings shift as they travel and how such shifts may affect
               interlocutors? understandings, (c) gaining leverage on the
               structure of subjects? social worlds, and (d) helping the
               ethnographer make larger causal arguments. We show the use value
               of these considerations through an analysis of violence and
               informal networks in an ethnography of immigrant Latinos who met

              Spatial Visualization Test — Visualization of Rotations (Guay,

              Rotations Test (Vandenberg \& Kuse, 1978) during the first six
              weeks of classes. The instruments were used to record student
              responses and response times as well as information on gender,
              current major, and number of previous graphics courses completed.
              The control group completed the original version of the PSVT

              completed a revised version of the PSVT (trimetric pictorials) and

                 way we think and perceive -- tools, when manipulated, are soon
                 absorbed into the body schema, and this absorption leads to
                 fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our
                 environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our
                 brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are
                 times when physically performing an activity is better than
                 watching someone else perform the activity, even though our
                 motor resonance system fires strongly during other person
                 observation; (4) there are times when we literallythinkwith
                 things. These four ideas have major implications for

               of a familiar representation to understand a new and complex
               representation. Finally, if learners abstract across multiple
               representations, they can construct a deeper understanding of the
               nature of the representations and the domain they represent. This
               chapter updates a review of studies that have used multiple

               information including irrelevant information, the same
               information presented concurrently in multiple forms or in
               unnecessarily elaborated form. According to cognitive load

               requirement to process unnecessary sources of information.
               Accordingly, instructional designs that eliminate redundant
               material can be superior to those that include redundancy. This

               better learning outcomes. In drawing, students have to translate

               Verbalizing activities involve generating words to distill key

               meaning of the material for oneself (learning by self-explaining)

               relationships (learning by mapping), or internal mental images
               that depict the content of the lesson (learning by imagining).

               depends on a number of factors, and in this chapter we focus on
               the content of the feedback message and compare corrective and
               explanatory feedback. Corrective feedback informs learners
               whether they were right or wrong, and explanatory feedback

                 the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of
                 training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality
                 (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based
                 training is as effective as traditional training methods.
                 BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training
                 tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of whether
                 or not these manipulations are effective for training has not
                 been quantitatively and conclusively answered. Evidence shows
                 that, while extended realities can often be time-saving and
                 cost-saving training mechanisms, their efficacy as training
                 tools has been debated. METHOD: The current body of literature
                 was examined and all qualifying articles pertaining to transfer
                 of training from MR, VR, and AR were included in the
                 meta-analysis. Effect sizes were calculated to determine the
                 effects that XR-based factors, trainee-based factors, and
                 task-based factors had on performance measures after XR-based
                 training. RESULTS: Results showed that training in XR does not
                 express a different outcome than training in a nonsimulated,
                 control environment. It is equally effective at enhancing
                 performance. CONCLUSION: Across numerous studies in multiple
                 fields, extended realities are as effective of a training
                 mechanism as the commonly accepted methods. The value of XR
                 then lies in providing training in circumstances, which exclude
                 traditional methods, such as situations when danger or cost may
                 make traditional training impossible.",

                 students (ages 10–11 years) using a head-mounted display and

              they need to develop a common spatial frame of reference and then
              choose a space coding to describe the objects’ positions. In this
              paper, we consider how the content of a virtual environment can
              influence communication between users. We designed two studies in
              which one participant (the speaker) had to indicate the position
              of one object to another participant (the addressee). The virtual
              environment was sometimes enriched by additional (proximal and
              distal) visual cues. In study 1, we considered statements
              production. We observed that the speakers most often used the
              avatar of their partner as a spatial reference to indicate a
              localization in the virtual space (i.e., Addressee-Centered
              coding) despite it increases their mental workload. Nevertheless,
              in complex situations, they also used distal cues to speak to the
              addressees (i.e., Exocentric coding of the space). In study 2, we
              considered statements comprehension. Addressee-Centered coding and
              Exocentric coding were used by the speakers in various spatial
              configurations to indicate the object position. We observed that
              Exocentric coding is the most difficult to manage for the
              addressee. These results indicate that speakers implemented the
              principle of less collaborative effort by adopting a way of
              exchanging information based on an asymmetrical cognitive cost,
              taking into consideration each other’s difficulties. This allows a
              balanced mental workload to be maintained between the two

              to create and maintain competent workers; unfortunately, most
              construction training and education research focuses on university
              student education. The focus of this dissertation research is the
              current state of educational-theory embedded construction
              workforce training, how such trainings are effective, and how they
              may be further optimized based on established educational theory.
              This is accomplished through a review of construction training for
              current industry professionals, an evaluation of the assessment
              criteria used to measure effectiveness, followed by the creation
              of a framework for construction training. There is a lack of
              recommendations for improvement of construction training across
              the industry. To establish the current state of construction
              industry training, a review of education theory-integrated
              training for construction professionals is undertaken. To measure
              the extent of educational theory integration, this dissertation
              summarizes studies that meet inclusion criteria, identifies the
              frequency of occurrence of Bloom’s Taxonomy verbs as a measure of
              student learning outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly
              used words within the identified construction training literature
              and foundational educational theory literature. The results
              provide a baseline of education theory-integrated construction
              training research, from which gaps and best practices can be
              identified. Existing construction training programs are not
              properly measured for effectiveness. A review of the current
              methodologies used in construction trainings published in archival
              literature is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of training
              programs. These practices are compared against the Kirkpatrick
              Model, an evaluation framework. The assessment methodologies in
              the literature are synthesized with corresponding levels found in
              the Kirkpatrick Model. Properly integrating educational theory
              into construction workforce training has the potential to improve
              industry training; however, there is a dearth of studies that
              present details of this integration process. To address this gap,
              a training framework is created to educate material installers on
              material properties, selection, and installation. This framework
              is based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
              principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
              similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
              training implementation. The created framework culminates by

               particular. It argues that historical inquiry, as a counterpart
               to other research methods, can add depth and range to our
               understanding of education, including religious education, and
               can illuminate important longer‐term, broader and philosophical
               issues. The article also argues that many historical voices have
               remained silent in the existing historiography of religious
               education because such historiography is too generalised and too
               biased towards the development of national policy and curriculum

                 methodologically and theoretically, medical education
                 researchers have been increasingly willing to challenge
                 taken-for-granted assumptions about the form, content and
                 function of medical education. In this AMEE guide we describe
                 historical, discourse and text analysis approaches that can
                 help researchers and educators question the inevitability of
                 things that are currently seen as 'natural'. Why is such
                 questioning important? By articulating our assumptions and
                 interrogating the 'naturalness' of the status quo, one can then
                 begin to ask why things are the way they are. Researchers can,
                 for example, ask whether the models of medical education
                 organization and delivery that currently seem 'natural' to them
                 have been developed in order to provide the most benefit to
                 students or patients--or whether they have, rather, been
                 developed in ways that provide power to faculty members,
                 medical schools or the medical profession as a whole. An
                 understanding of the interplay of practices and power is a
                 valuable tool for opening up the field to new possibilities for
                 better medical education. The recognition that our current
                 models, rather than being 'natural', were created in particular
                 historical contexts for any number of contingent reasons leads
                 inexorably to the possibility of change. For if our current
                 ways of doing things are not, in fact, inevitable, not only can
                 they be questioned, they can be made better; they can changed
                 in ways that are attentive to whom they benefit, are congruent
                 with our current beliefs about best practice and may lead to

               challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices. Offsite
               production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods of
               construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help
               improve construction industry performance as well as meet new
               market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and
               sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems, if
               not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and be
               counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
               construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the
               specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP
               systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and consequently
               improve industry performance.On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually
               sought to facilitate ‘experiential’ learning, which is argued to
               be particularly effective where a great deal of independence is
               granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been criticised
               for being expensive, limited, and sometimes devoid of the actual
               training context. In order to address the problems encountered
               with OJT, several virtual reality (VR) solutions have been
               proposed. This paper introduces one such VR solution prototype,
               in order to provide a risk-free environment for learning without
               the ‘do-or-die’ consequences often faced on real construction
               projects. The proffered solution provides a unique VR environment
               for practicing new working conditions associated with OSP
               practices. While the ‘scenes’ of the VR environment take place on
               a construction site, the environment predominantly targets
               professionals, such as project managers, construction managers,
               architects, designers, suppliers and manufacturers, to allow
               multidisciplinary learning to occur, and hence overcome
               ‘knowledge silos’ or ‘knowledge compartmentation’. The VR
               environment enables unforeseen problems often caused by
               professionals’ decisions, faulty work, and health and safety
               issues to occur; where the implications of which can be evaluated
               in respect of time, cost and resources. The VR environment
               proposed does not aim to resolve problems associated with OSP per
               se, rather aims to allow ‘things to go wrong’ and consequently
               allows users not only to ‘experience’ the resulting implications
               but also to reflect on those implications as part of the learning
               process. This paper discusses and presents the prototype for the
               first development phase of the VR interactive training
               environment. While the prototype was tested and validated with
               domain experts from industry, the research community, and
               academia from different EU countries, the data used in developing
               the prototype was constrained to one project in the UK which may
               limit the generalisability of results.",

               for its poor performance, poor image and inability to attract and
               retain workers. Offsite production (OSP) under the overarching
               umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC) was sought by
               the UK Government to ameliorate the UK construction industry,
               meet market demands and overcome manual skill shortages.
               Nevertheless, professional skills shortages are argued to be as
               acute as manual skills shortfalls. In this respect,
               industry?academia collaboration is anticipated to provide
               professional skills needed for OSP and, hence, effect change.
               This paper reports the findings from the first stage of an
               ongoing triangulated research project. In this context, a survey
               was carried out to capture the perceptions of both the UK
               construction industry and academia with respect to OSP and
               preferable means for collaboration, in an attempt to explore
               common grounds for possible collaborations. A quantitative
               approach was primarily used for data collection and analysis. The
               findings from 36 large construction organizations (representing a
               20\% response rate) and 20 construction-related higher-education
               institutions (representing a 32\% response rate) suggested that
               although the industry considered OSP to be the future of the UK
               construction industry, there seemed to be uncertainty about what
               OSP actually entailed. Notwithstanding these issues, academia
               either did not know or refuted that OSP is the future of the
               construction industry, hence suggesting a lack of shared
               understanding between industry and academia with respect to
               skills requirements and preferred means for collaboration.
               Further research is needed to bridge the gap between these
               apparent polarized views.",

               artist-drawn construction aids called visual scaffolding are

               pencil sketching, geometric massing and eraser marks, are

               of new object-space techniques for high-fidelity pen-and-ink

               approach which leverages both the implicit surface definition and

               computing silhouettes, suggestive contours, surface stippling,

               dialogue is examined and four patterns of interaction involving

               play a critical role in articulating and amplifying that
               knowledge. A theoretical framework is developed which provides an

               composite of techniques derived from behavioral, cognitive, and
               social learning theories. Behavioral learning principles underlie
               exposure therapy, one of the most efficacious interventions to
               date, as well as a handful of diverse CBT interventions, which
               apply principles of reinforcement to decrease maladaptive
               behaviors. Cognitive strategies within CBT utilize principles
               from theories of constructivism, attribution theory, and
               metacognition to aid clients in learning how thoughts impact
               feelings. Finally, social learning theory, which focuses on
               learning in the context of interpersonal relationships,
               interactions, and observations, plays a role in CBT, relying

  abstract    = "Since January 1, 2007, Government legislation in Western
                 Australia required all workers in construction to complete
                 mandatory safety awareness training before they began work on
                 site. During the implementation of this new legislation there
                 was considerable resistance from the construction sector due to
                 the mandatory nature of the training. The construction industry
                 viewed this as an unnecessary impost as they considered that
                 there was already sufficient safety training delivered through
                 individual company and site inductions. In 2010, we evaluated
                 the new Construction Induction Training (CIT) in the commercial
                 construction sector in Western Australia to find that since
                 2007 there has been an unanticipated change in support for the
                 mandatory training. The 2010 study shows a shift in the values
                 of the safety culture for the commercial sector of the
                 construction industry. In 2010, the industry not only supports
                 the mandatory CIT, but is very vocal in its request to
                 re-institute the refresher courses that were withdrawn in 2009.
                 Indeed, 79\% of respondents claimed there were measurable
                 benefits to their business having their employees complete the
                 CIT, while 96\% claimed the CIT assisted in reducing
                 accidents/incidents on their worksites. This 2010 study
                 indicates that in this case, mandatory training has had a
                 positive effect on safety culture change and gradually reduced
                 work-related injury in the industry since 2007 to the present.
                 The paper uses data from two studies conducted in 2006 and 2010
                 to highlight the unanticipated change in perception of the
                 value of mandatory safety training in the WA construction
                 industry to one which is positive and supportive.",

                 neural processes that support performance. For example,
                 performing a specific action improves the execution of that
                 action via changes in associated sensory and motor neural
                 circuitry, and experience using language improves language
                 comprehension by altering the anatomy and physiology of
                 perisylvian neocortical brain regions. Here we provide evidence
                 that specialized (sports) motor experience enhances
                 action-related language understanding by recruitment of left
                 dorsal lateral premotor cortex, a region normally devoted to
                 higher-level action selection and implementation-even when
                 there is no intention to perform a real action. Experience
                 playing and watching sports has enduring effects on language
                 understanding by changing the neural networks that subserve
                 comprehension to incorporate areas active in performing sports
                 skills. Without such experience, sport novices recruit
                 lower-level sensory-motor regions, thought to support the
                 instantiation of movement, during language processing, and
                 activity in primary motor areas does not help comprehension.
                 Thus, the language system is sufficiently plastic and dynamic
                 to encompass expertise-related neural recruitment outside core

               reducing cost and time, improving design and enhancing overall

               (AR), in particular, have proven to be extremely beneficial in
               this field. However, the application and usage of these

              Federation of Teachers",
  abstract = "IN ANCIENT times, teaching and learning were accomplished through
              apprenticeship: We taught our children how to speak, grow crops,
              craft cabinets, or tailor clothes by showing them how and by
              helping them do it. Apprenticeship was the vehicle for
              transmitting the knowledge required for expert practice in fields
              from painting and sculpting to medicine and law. It was the
              natural way to learn. In modern times, apprenticeship has largely
              been replaced by formal schooling, except in children's learning
              of language, in some aspects of graduate education, and in
              on-the-job training. We propose an alternative model of
              instruction that is accessible within the framework of the typical
              American classroom. It is a model of instruction that goes back to
              apprenticeship but incorporates elements of schooling. We call
              this model ``cognitive apprenticeship'' While there are many
              differences between schooling and apprenticeship methods, we will
              focus on one. In apprenticeship, learners can see the processes of
              work: They watch a parent sow, plant, and harvest crops and help
              as they are able; they assist a tradesman as he crafts a cabinet;
              they piece together garments under the supervision of a more
              experienced tailor. Apprenticeship involves learning a physical,
              tangible activity. But in schooling, the ``practice'' of problem
              solving, reading comprehension, and writing is not at all
              obvious-it is not necessarily observable to the student. In
              apprenticeship, the processes of the activity are visible. In
              schooling, the processes of thinking are often invisible to both
              the students and the teacher. Cognitive apprenticeship is a model
              of instruction that works to make thinking visible. In this
              article, we will present some of the features of traditional
              apprenticeship and discuss the ways it can be adapted to the
              teaching and learning of cognitive skills. Then we will present
              three successful examples-cases in which teachers and researchers
              have used apprenticeship methods to teach reading, writing, and
              mathematics. In the final section, we organize our ideas about the
              characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
              for the design of learning environments, where ``environment''
              includes the content taught, the pedagogical methods employed, the
              sequencing of learning activities, and the sociology of learning.
              Although schools have been relatively successful in organizing and
              conveying large bodies of conceptual and factual knowledge,
              standard pedagogical practices render key aspects of expertise
              invisible to students. Too little attention is paid to the
              reasoning and strategies that experts employ when they acquire
              knowledge or …",

                 However, the design of digital touch is a challenge, especially

              engineering interfaces for usability and utility up to the 1990s
              to the current ideal of designing interfaces for experience and
              meaning. Next, we identify three recent technical and societal
              developments that are challenging the existing ideals of
              interaction design, namely the move towards hybrid
              physical/digital materials, the emergence of an increasingly
              complex and fluid digital ecology, and the increasing proportion
              of autonomous or partially autonomous systems changing their
              behavior over time and with use. These challenges in turn motivate
              us to propose three directions in which new ideals for interaction
              design might be sought: the first is to go beyond the
              language-body divide that implicitly frames most of our current
              understandings of experience and meaning, the second is to extend
              the scope of interaction design from individual interfaces to the
              complex sociotechnical fabric of human and nonhuman actors, and
              the third is to go beyond predictability by learning to design
              with machine learning.",

               shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
               construction sector in the European Union Member States,
               foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of people
               is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which also
               includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages in the EU
               are expected to increase in the future due to a declining
               population and an ageing workforce. In order to recognize and
               forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use a variety of
               instruments but they do not answer as to whether it is possible
               to use migrant labour to appease those shortages. There are
               several systems used to classify labour shortages in the EU
               Member states. Most of the countries classify labour shortages in
               relation to different sectors or occupation groups as well as by
               skill levels, but in some Member States, classification is made
               according to the type of employment. Instruments used to measure
               labour shortages significantly differ from country to country.
               Several criteria are used for creating lists of shortage
               occupations and most of the criteria include demand side and
               supply side criteria. A majority of the Member States are facing
               labour and skill shortages in various sectors and the
               construction sector is not an exception. As total employment in
               the construction sector decreased, so did the share of employed
               migrants. Labour shortages in the construction sector can be
               eased by the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
               unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
               low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
               the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be working,
               which has an impact on the development and implementation dynamic

               4.0 framework for the construction sector. Industry 4.0 promises
               to revolutionize how ‘things’ are made by using physical and
               digital technologies in an integrated manner. Similarly, the
               authors envision that the Construction 4.0 framework can
               fundamentally change the way that assets are designed,
               constructed, and operated. The idea of the Construction 4.0
               developed from the need of the construction sector to overcome
               the existing horizontal, vertical, and longitudinal fragmentation
               and to take a holistic approach to the improvements needed in the
               industry. In this study, a literature review of Industry 4.0 and
               its influence on the construction sector was undertaken. Based on
               this systematic literature review, the authors define the
               Construction 4.0 framework and provide its benefits and barriers
               to implementation. A key finding of the study is that building
               information modeling, and a common data environment form the key
               foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0
               framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the paper
               described its components and how its implementation is likely to
               proceed. The authors envision that by adopting Construction 4.0,
               the industry can transform itself into a highly efficient,
               quality-centered, and safe industry capable of successfully
               delivering the demands placed on it by society.",

              terms of improvements in productivity and quality, this concept
              has not gained much attention in the construction industry. This

               approach to be the most important means of bringing about
               improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
               research and the weaknesses of existing preventative approaches
               and then to describe and illustrate a new application involving
               the use of a multi‐dimensional simulation tool – Construction
               Virtual Prototyping (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA literature
               review was conducted to investigate previous studies of hazard
               identification and safety management and to develop the new
               approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the research
               study explored the use of computer simulation techniques to
               create virtual environments where users can explore and identify
               construction hazards. Specifically, virtual prototyping
               technology was deployed to develop typical construction scenarios
               in which unsafe or hazardous incidents occur. In a case study,
               the users' performance was evaluated based on their responses to
               incidents within the virtual environment and the effectiveness of
               the computer simulation system established though interviews with
               the safety project management team.FindingsThe opinions and
               suggestions provided by the interviewees led to the initial
               conclusion that the simulation tool was useful in assisting the
               safety management team's hazard identification process during the
               early design stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an
               innovative method to support the management team's reviews of
               construction site safety. The system utilises three‐dimensional
               modelling and four‐dimensional simulation of worker behaviour, a
               configuration that has previously not been employed in
               construction simulations. An illustration of the method's use is
               also provided, together with a consideration of its strengths and

              lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
              about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
              programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
              entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal value.
              Today they do not always meet current building standards and many
              are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes programme
              incorporated a large variety of technical building solutions,
              andknowledge about former building practices is needed if
              refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in
              Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of
              sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of
              assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for
              housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process
              content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also
              contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as
              part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform
              concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase
              the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
              buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should be on
              the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge and
              especially on social motivations. It is important that managers
              and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as this will
              lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge sharing is
              the norm; in the context of this study this is especially
              important for the creation of an efficient platform concept for

               is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer their
               design to different degrees, resulting in variations of the
               engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order, adapt-to-order, and
               engineer-to-stock. This variation causes different settings for
               the use of platforms in house-building. The aim of this research
               is to diversify the engineer-to-order production strategy and its
               consequences for platform organization by studying its use in
               house-building. The multiple case study on four
               engineering/contractor firms reports the core capabilities for
               engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market
               knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and
               coordination of sales and manufacturing. Design-to-order,
               adapt-to-order and engineer-to stock were shown to be production
               strategies in use in house-building. In design-to-order platforms
               parts of the platform are undefined while engineer-to-stock
               platforms are fully predefined. Coordination between market and
               manufacturing is a crucial capability when engaging in platform
               organization. When an engineering firm and a contractor
               collaborate to fulfil client needs, the coordination capability
               between market and manufacturing was shown to be low. The case
               study shows that specialized contractors who integrate the supply
               chain towards a specific market segment benefit fully from the
               platform concept, while contractors with a wider scope could

               social formations whose participants engage with each other as a

               conceive of learning as a special universal mental process
               impoverish and misrecognize it. My colleagues and I have been
               trying to convey out understanding of this claim for some years

               putatively common starting point becomes grounds for labeling
               others sub-normal. The logic that makes success exceptional but
               nonetheless characterizes lack of success as not normal won't do.

                 learning theories offered in the wider education literature and
                 a relatively narrow range of theories privileged in the medical
                 education literature. The latter are usually described under
                 the heading of 'adult learning theory'. METHODS: This paper
                 critically addresses the limitations of the current dominant
                 learning theories informing medical education. An argument is
                 made that such theories, which address how an individual
                 learns, fail to explain how learning occurs in dynamic, complex
                 and unstable systems such as fluid clinical teams. RESULTS:
                 Models of learning that take into account distributed knowing,
                 learning through time as well as space, and the complexity of a
                 learning environment including relationships between persons
                 and artefacts, are more powerful in explaining and predicting
                 how learning occurs in clinical teams. Learning theories may be
                 privileged for ideological reasons, such as medicine's concern
                 with autonomy. CONCLUSIONS: Where an increasing amount of
                 medical education occurs in workplace contexts, sociocultural
                 learning theories offer a best-fit exploration and explanation
                 of such learning. We need to continue to develop testable
                 models of learning that inform safe work practice. One type of
                 learning theory will not inform all practice contexts and we
                 need to think about a range of fit-for-purpose theories that
                 are testable in practice. Exciting current developments include
                 dynamicist models of learning drawing on complexity theory.",

                 radical pedagogical innovation in medical education in the UK
                 during the 1990s. Part of this thinking was to include the
                 medical humanities as a medium for re-thinking medical
                 practice, especially how medical students might better learn to

                 become agents of change in progressing medicine through
                 innovations. In designing the curriculum, Cultural-historical
                 Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as a model to 'think', or
                 reconceptualise, the purposes of a curriculum. The first
                 question asked was: 'what do patients want?' Emphasis was

               techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in different
               fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to another.
               This study provides a detailed discussion on the development of
               the human capital theory under various themes and sub-themes. The
               study further seeks to discuss the several effects of human
               capital development on industry success and competitiveness and
               how this contributes to economic growth in developing countries.
               Relevant literatures on HC theory and development were extracted
               from Scopus. Scopus is widely acknowledged as one of the widest
               interdisciplinary databases for engineering, technology, science
               and medicine. The Scopus database features over 20, 000+
               peer-reviewed journals from over 5000 publishers. The Scopus
               database allows its users to perform more detailed searching

               Complete, Art and Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host, SpringerLink
               and Web of science. The distillation of literature through
               thematic analysis revealed the various roles of human capital and
               its correlation with construction industry success and growth.
               Findings from this study revealed that the success of the
               construction industry is firmly related to the effectiveness of
               its human capital. The study revealed that the human capital
               theory is not without its criticisms and barriers. Practically,
               this study explores the various benefits of human capital to
               employers of the construction industry. The study suggests that
               human capital development plays a key part in retaining quality
               employees and recruiting prospects. Furthermore, investment in
               human capital goes a long way in improving employee satisfaction,

              and digitalisation to improve production and distribution
              processes. In this context, some authors have proposed the concept
              of “Construction 4.0” as the counterpart of Industry 4.0 for the
              construction sector, although the methodological-technological
              implications are not clear. This research shows a
              methodological-technological framework adapted to the
              Architecture, Engineering, Construction, and Operations industry.
              This papers includes a detailed proposal for a reference
              frameworks and related technologies that could impact on this
              sector, responding to its complexities and specific challenges,
              such as the unique spaces for each work, which are difficult to
              standardise, arbitrary cost overruns and a productivity far below
              the average for other industries, increasing competitiveness and
              globalisation, as opposed to its traditionally local deployment,
              and an increasing demand to reduce the carbon footprint for all
              its activities.",

               Construction 4.0, coined in 2016 in Germany. Since its definition
               is still diffuse, it was deemed necessary to conduct a review on
               the publications in this field to grasp how this concept is being
               understood. For that purpose, a bibliometric analysis was
               conducted among 260 research articles using seven keywords. The
               results reveal that the number of publications is growing
               exponentially, with the USA, the UK, and China being leaders in
               this field; besides, four technologies are essential to
               understand Construction 4.0 at present time: 3D printing, big
               data, virtual reality, and Internet of Things. The results of

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose careers
               and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It utilizes

               doing a research project into achievable stages. It delivers
               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't break
               over a page, making even complex concepts easier to understand.
               Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design, regular
               progress checkpoints have been built into the book and its online
               resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps, each chapter
               provides regular opportunities for students to check
               understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway then
               gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop, practise with
               quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at a concept a
               different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth of additional

               patterns, the UK construction industry recently has made
               considerable efforts to attract more women to its professions.
               However, despite their increasing representation, there are
               indications that women experience difficulties in developing
               their careers within the industry. This research investigated the
               careers of men and women working for large construction
               companies, in order to establish the gender determined influences
               on women's career progression. A primarily qualitative
               methodology was employed for the research, in which career
               profiles were developed through ethnographic interviews with 41
               matched pairs of male and female employees. This allowed the
               gender specific determinants of careers to be established across
               a range of different organizations, and from informants at
               different vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis resulted
               in the formulation of a set of eight interrelated theoretical
               models, from which a theory of women's career development was
               constructed. The theory reflects the belief that the construction
               workplace is a competitive and conflictual environment, where
               women are overtly and covertly discriminated against by men, who
               use structural systems to undermine their participation. The
               women interviewed were found to have dealt with these barriers in
               a way which perpetuated existing work cultures. If reflected
               throughout the industry, this would suggest the existence of a
               self-fulfilling cycle of women's continued under-achievement. The
               paper puts forward the radical proposition that women should not
               be attracted to the industry unless steps are taken to moderate
               its exclusionary and discriminatory culture.",

               state where contemplated questions are of more value than hasty

               theory formulation than theory testing. More specifically, it
               derives a grounded theory of construction crisis management which
               forms a useful basis for future research. It does so from an
               investigation of the complex patterns of communication and
               behaviour which emerge in response to construction crises. The
               conclusion is that construction crisis management is about the
               effective control of social and behavioural instability and the
               conflict which arises out of it. However, effective crisis
               management is made difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms
               which construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory
               also is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
               thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
               context is identified.",

                 understanding of a single concept, in this case: veterinary
                 workplace clinical training (WCT), which occurs just prior to
                 students' graduation as competent veterinary surgeons. The
                 competency movement has strongly influenced reforms in
                 veterinary education and is considered important. In reflection
                 of this, the term ``preparedness'' is operationalised here as a
                 measure of the likelihood that the veterinary student is going
                 to be a competent learner and participant during WCT.
                 Preparedness itself is therefore important because it directly
                 impacts performance. Workplace clinical training is explored
                 through the lenses of cognitivist, social constructivist and
                 socio-culturalist learning theories and used to inform student

                 awarenesses to optimise learning and participation. These form

               implemented periodically in many countries, existing buildings
               continually consume a momentous quota of the total primary
               energy. Energy efficiency solutions range from material
               components to bulk systems. A technique of building construction,
               referred to as prefabricated architecture (prefab), is increasing
               in reputation. Prefab encompasses the offsite fabrication of
               building components to a greater degree of finish as bulk
               building structures and systems, and their assembly on-site. In
               this context, prefab improves the speed of construction, quality
               of architecture, efficiency of materials, and worker safety,
               while limiting environmental impacts of construction, as compared
               to conventional site-built construction practices. Quite
               recently, a 57 story skyscraper was built in 19 days using
               prefabricated modules. From the building physics point of view,
               the bulk systems and tighter integration method of prefab
               minimizes thermal bridges. This study seeks to clearly
               characterize the levels of prefab and to investigate the
               performance of modular prefab; considering acoustic constrain,
               seismic resistance, thermal behavior, energy consumption, and
               life cycle analysis of existing prefab cases and, thus, provides
               a dynamic case study-based review. Generally, prefab can be
               categorized into components, panels (2D), modules (3D), hybrids,
               and unitized whole buildings. On average, greenhouse gas
               emissions from conventional construction were higher than for
               modular construction, not discounting some individual
               discrepancies. Few studies have focused on monitored data on
               prefab and occupants’ comfort but additional studies are required
               to understand the public’s perception of the technology. The
               scope of the work examined will be of interest to building
               engineers, manufacturers, and energy experts, as well as serve as

                 frame the performance of social similarity and difference. It
                 argues that 'the social' does not exist as a single spatial
                 type, but rather performs itself in a recursive and
                 topologically heterogeneous manner. Using material drawn from a
                 study of the way in which tropical doctors handle anaemia, it
                 explores three different social topologies. First, there are
                 'regions' in which objects are clustered together, and
                 boundaries are drawn round each cluster. Second, there are
                 'networks' in which distance is a function of relations between
                 elements, and difference a matter of relational variety. These
                 two forms of spatiality are often mobilized in social theory.
                 However, we argue that there are other kinds of social space,
                 and here consider the possible character of a third, that of
                 'fluid spatiality'. In this, places are neither delineated by
                 boundaries, nor linked through stable relations: instead,
                 entities may be similar and dissimilar at different locations
                 within fuid space. In addition, they may transform themselves
                 without creating difference.",

                   models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers
                   (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased
                   capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to
                   LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations
                   based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating
                   both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings
                   reveal that around 80\% of the U.S. workforce could have at
                   least 10\% of their work tasks affected by the introduction
                   of LLMs, while approximately 19\% of workers may see at least
                   50\% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions
                   about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The
                   projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income
                   jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities
                   and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are
                   not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity
                   growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM,
                   about 15\% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed
                   significantly faster at the same level of quality. When
                   incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this
                   share increases to between 47 and 56\% of all tasks. This
                   finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a
                   substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the
                   underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit
                   traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they
                   could have considerable economic, social, and policy

                 hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated several deficits
                 in many aspects. However, no previous study employed
                 quantitative methodology providing objective measures that
                 could be compared among different studies with diverse samples.
                 To fill this gap, we used network analysis to investigate how
                 ADHD symptomatology impacts narrative discourse, a complex
                 linguistic task considered to be an ecological measure of
                 language. Fifty-eight adults (34 females and 24 males) with a
                 mean age of 26 years old and a mean of 17 years of educational
                 level were administered the Adult Self-Rating Scale for ADHD
                 symptomatology. They also completed the State-Trait Anxiety
                 Inventory, the Beck Depression Inventory and the Urgency,
                 Premeditation, Perseverance, Sensation Seeking Behavior Scale.
                 Intelligence quotient was calculated. Individuals were asked to
                 tell a story based on a wordless picture book. Speech was
                 recorded and transcribed as an input to SpeechGraphs software.
                 Parameters were total number of words (TNW), number of loops of
                 one node (L1), repeated edges (RE), largest strongly connected
                 component (LSC) and average shortest path (ASP). Verbosity was
                 controlled. Statistical analysis was corrected for multiples
                 comparisons and partial correlations were performed for
                 confounding variables. After controlling for anxiety,
                 depression, IQ, and impulsiveness ADHD symptomatology was
                 positively correlated with L1 and negatively correlated with
                 LSC. TNW was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. In a
                 subdomain analysis, both inattention and
                 hyperactivity-impulsivity were negatively correlated with LSC.
                 Only hyperactivity-impulsivity positively correlated with TNW
                 and L1. Results indicated a correlation between ADHD symptoms
                 and lower connectedness in narrative discourse (as indicated by
                 higher L1 and lower LSC), as well as higher total number of
                 words (TNW). Our results suggest that the higher the number of

                 importance, however, the malleability of this skill through
                 practice has scarcely been studied empirically, in contrast to
                 psychometric spatial ability. Thus, this article examines the
                 possibility of improving the accuracy of configurational
                 understanding of the environment by training. A total of 40
                 adults with a poor sense of direction participated in the
                 experiment; and were randomly assigned to either a condition in
                 which they received feedback only or a condition in which they
                 additionally practiced allocentric spatial updating.
                 Participants walked one route in each session, once a week for
                 6 weeks, and conducted spatial tasks designed to assess their
                 knowledge of the route. A total of 20 people with an average
                 sense of direction also participated as a comparison group.
                 Results showed that training in allocentric spatial updating
                 improved the accuracy of direction estimates, although the size
                 of the effect was limited: the improvement was not large enough
                 to equate the performance in the groups with a poor versus
                 average sense of direction. The two groups, however, did not
                 differ in spatial skill in mental rotation or path integration.
                 Feedback was effective for improving accuracy in straight-line
                 distance estimates and sketch maps: repeated trials with
                 feedback led to improved accuracy by the sixth session to a
                 level comparable to the group with an average sense of
                 direction. The results show that flexible translation between
                 viewer-centered and environment-centered representations is
                 difficult and not readily trainable, and provide insights into
                 the nature of individual differences in large-scale
                 environmental cognition.",

              construction sector's sustainability concerns, including high
              carbon emissions, health and safety risks, low productivity, and
              increasing costs. Applying Industry 4.0 technologies to
              construction (also referred to as Construction 4.0) could address
              some of these concerns. However, current understanding about this
              is quite limited, with previous work being largely fragmented and
              limited both in terms of technologies as well as their
              interrelationships with the triple bottom line of sustainability
              perspectives. The focus of this article is therefore on addressing
              these gaps by proposing a comprehensive multi-dimensional
              Construction 4.0 sustainability framework that identifies and
              categorizes the key Construction 4.0 technologies and their
              positive and negative impacts on environmental, economic, and
              social sustainability, and then establishing its
              applicability/usefulness through an empirical, multimethodology
              case study assessment of the UAE's construction sector. The
              findings indicate Construction 4.0’s positive impacts on
              environmental and economic sustainability that far outweigh its
              negative effects, although these impacts are comparable with
              regards to social sustainability. On Construction 4.0 technologies
              itself, their application was found to be nonuniform with greater
              application seen for building information modeling and automation
              vis-à-vis others such as cyber-physical systems and smart
              materials, with significant growth expected in the future for
              blockchain- and three-dimensional-printing-related technologies.
              The proposed novel framework could enable the development of
              policy interventions and support mechanisms to increase
              Construction 4.0 deployment while addressing its negative
              sustainability-related impacts. The framework also has the
              potential to be adapted and applied to other country and sectoral
              contexts.",

              in the engineering and construction sectors, and thus to better
              understand the impact and how these sectors might be
              overcome.Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a
              sequential mixed qualitative and quantitative data collection and
              analysis approach. DT barriers were first identified from relevant
              literature and verified by an expert panel. Then, a questionnaire
              survey assessing the impacts of the identified DT barriers was
              distributed to construction professionals in China, and 192 valid
              responses were retrieved. Further, the data obtained were analyzed
              using ranking analysis, exploratory factor analysis (EFA), and
              partial least squares-structural equation modeling
              (PLS-SEM).Findings Based on the ranking analysis, the top three
              barriers are “lack of industry-specific standards and laws,” “lack
              of clear vision, strategy and direction for DT,” and “lack of
              support from top management for DT.” EFA enabled the grouping of
              the 26 barriers into 3 categories: (1) lack of laws and
              regulations (LLR), (2) lack of support and leadership (LSL), and
              (3) lack of resources and professionals (LRP). The PLS-SEM
              analysis revealed that LLR, LSL, and LRP were found to have
              significant negative impacts on DT.Originality/value These
              findings contribute to the body of knowledge on DT in the
              construction industry and help construction firms and government
              bodies improve the understanding of these barriers to DT and put
              forward relevant policies and incentives, thus seizing the DT
              benefits as a way to enhance construction project management.",

               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising wages
               above the competitive level. For a union to be able to increase
               wage rates above the competitive level, there must be some
               surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union, and
               the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm to
               share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The

               of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may enhance
               efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor turnover and
               negotiating costs, they may increase the available surplus to be

               at least four elements: contexts, theories, actions and persons
               (who hold theories and perform actions in specific contexts
               rather than acting in possible, abstracted, universal or armchair
               worlds). The relationships of these elements, what is taken as
               praxis, is discussed and in particular the complex nature of
               personhood is canvassed. It is suggested that insufficient

               Pedagogical praxis begins with the premise that under the right

               it easier for students to become active participants in
               meaningful projects and practices in the life of their community

               mediation, and journalism can provide constructive models for
               helping students learn from such experiences. In this vision, new
               technology reinvigorates Dewey's (1915) idea of linking school
               with society. Technology builds a bridge that allows young people
               to participate in the learning practices of professionals; in the
               process, they develop epistemological frameworks that organize
               the skills, habits, and understandings they need to thrive in a
               complex, postindustrial society. Although further work needs to
               be done to explore the processes through which such learning can

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: Grounded theory (GT) is an established qualitative
                 research method, but few papers have encapsulated the benefits,
                 limits, and basic tenets of doing GT research on user and
                 provider experiences of health care services. GT can be used to
                 guide the entire study method, or it can be applied at the data
                 analysis stage only. METHODS: We summarize key components of GT
                 and common GT procedures used by qualitative researchers in
                 health care research. We draw on our experience of conducting a
                 GT study on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients' experiences
                 of health care services. FINDINGS: We discuss why some
                 approaches in GT research may work better than others,
                 particularly when the focus of study is hard-to-reach
                 population groups. We highlight the flexibility of procedures
                 in GT to build theory about how people engage with health care
                 services. CONCLUSION: GT enables researchers to capture and
                 understand health care experiences. GT methods are particularly
                 valuable when the topic of interest has not previously been
                 studied. GT can be applied to bring structure and rigor to the
                 analysis of qualitative data.",

               of digital tools available to further analyse complex phenomena
               with interrelated data sets. However, few GT researchers have
               systematically examined how the use of diagramming tools can
               enhance analysis. To advance the analytical process of GT, this
               study develops a multi-representational approach that integrates
               with research design. After diagrams supportive of GT are
               identified for their potential improvements to the analytical
               process, the research focuses on the experience of employing
               three diagramming tools (Flourish, Observable, and Pajek) in
               developing two complementary diagrams (Network and Arc diagrams).
               The use of these tools for analysis is explained in detail for
               conducting extensive constructivist GT study; illustrated via a
               case study examining a century of innovation in hospital design.
               Via this multiple-source case study, this paper demonstrates how
               the sagacious deployment of diagramming tools, when carefully
               aligned to research objectives, can complement GT analysis by
               facilitating systematic thinking and holistic interpretation of

  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how
               industrialized house building (IHB) could support productivity
               developments for housebuilding on project and industry levels.
               The take is that fragmentation of construction is one explanation
               for the lack of productivity growth, and that IHB could be an
               integrating method of overcoming horizontal and vertical
               fragmentation. Design/methodology/approach Singe-factor
               productivity measures are calculated based on data reported by
               IHB companies and compared to official produced and published
               research data. The survey covers the years 2013–2020 for IHB
               companies building multi-storey houses in timber. Generalization
               is sought through descriptive statistics by contrasting the data
               samples to the used means to control vertical and horizontal
               fragmentation formulated as three theoretical propositions.
               Findings According to the results, IHB in timber is on average
               more productive than conventional housebuilding at the company
               level, project level, in absolute and in growth terms over the
               eight-year period. On the company level, the labour productivity
               was on average 10\% higher for IHB compared to general
               construction and positioned between general construction and
               general manufacturing. On the project level, IHB displayed an
               average cost productivity growth of 19\% for an employed
               prefabrication degree of about 45\%. Originality/value Empirical
               evidence is presented quantifying so far perceived advantages of
               IHB. By providing analysis of actual cost and project data
               derived from IHB companies, the article quantifies previous
               research that IHB is not only about prefabrication. The observed
               positive productivity growth in relation to the employed
               prefabrication degree indicates that off-site production is not a
               sufficient mean for reaching high productivity and productivity
               growth. Instead, the capabilities to integrate the operative
               logic of conventional housebuilding together with logic of IHB
               platform development and use is a probable explanation of the
               observed positive productivity growth.",

               delivered by the private sector using predominantly traditional,
               site-based, construction methods. Recently, the house-building
               industry has found itself under increasing pressure to raise
               production output to alleviate a shortage in housing supply and
               reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there has been
               much interest in the potential offered by off-site construction
               (OSC). The production strategies employed by private
               house-building firms however, are a direct response to their
               operational environment, and the adoption of OSC would arguably
               alter the way that they deliver their developments. Hence, there
               is a clear need to understand the relationship between production
               strategy and construction methods. Based on a case study of one
               of the largest private house-building firms in the UK, the
               potential impacts of OSC on current production strategies have
               been explored. The results indicate that the adoption of OSC
               approaches may alter the manner in which house-building firms are
               able to manage their production process, reducing their control
               and restricting the very flexibility on which their own success
               relies. The findings have implications for the housebuilding
               industry, OSC manufacturers and construction research, given the
               ongoing interest in OSC as a means to address the UK’s housing

               approaches to the study of sociology were taken as the

               invites an understanding of everyday practices as constitutive of
               social differences. The appeal of habitus lies in its ability to
               uncover social inequalities in a way that keeps agency and
               structure simultaneously in focus. However, there are also
               problems in operationalising habitus, chiefly because of the
               indeterminacy of the concept. In order to overcome these
               difficulties I have outlined four key components of habitus and
               attempted to delineate the aspects of habitus as method that seem
               most relevant to primary classrooms. Finally, drawing on
               ethnographic data gathered over 15 months of participant
               observation in two primary classrooms, the article seeks to
               explore through the lens of habitus how differences of gender,
               'race' and class are produced by children in primary classrooms.
               Although I make no claims for my own empirical work it does
               suggest that habitus as method has the potential to reveal the
               taken-for-granted inequalities embedded in everyday practices.]",

               have occupied the academic literature for decades. Those arguing
               in favor plead for greater rigor and clarity to determine “what
               works.” Those arguing against protest that education is a
               complex, social endeavor and that for epistemological,
               theoretical and political reasons it is not possible to state,
               with any useful degree of generalizable certainty, “what works.”
               While academics argue, policy and practice in Higher Education
               are beset with problems. Ineffective methods such as “Learning
               Styles” persist. Teaching quality and teacher performance are
               measured using subjective and potentially biased feedback.
               University educators have limited access to professional
               development, particularly for practical teaching skills. There is
               a huge volume of higher education research, but it is
               disconnected from educational practice. Change is needed. We
               propose a pragmatic model of Evidence-Based Higher Education,
               empowering educators and others to make judgements about the
               application of the most useful evidence, in a particular context,
               including pragmatic considerations of cost and other resources.
               Implications of the model include a need to emphasize pragmatic
               approaches to research in higher education, delivering results
               that are more obviously useful, and a pragmatic focus on
               practical teaching skills for the development of educators in

               of practitioners and students, and second, to present findings
               and recommendations for increasing the effectiveness of skill

               research design/methodology is based primarily on survey research
               on skill development in MBA programmes from the perspectives of
               both graduates and marketing practitioners.FindingsThis research
               suggests that six important skill weaknesses – decision making,
               leadership, problem formulation, persuasion, creativity, and
               negotiation – need to be developed among future marketers and
               that a marketing education framework should be based on the
               pillars of a project and dissertation, classroom debate and
               discussion, and oral presentations.Research
               limitations/implicationsFuture research should focus on
               understanding and explaining to an even greater extent how
               marketing education can make more effective use of interactive,

               marketing skill development as well.Originality/valueThe new and

               extensively characterises and quantifies the extent of a
               marketing skill development gap – the gap between what marketing
               skills are being developed in MBA programmes and what

               construction project's turnover on buying goods and services, and
               thus suppliers have a large impact on project performance.
               Therefore, the purchasing function management of the prime
               contractor has a large influence on the overall performance: the
               more developed (i.e. mature or professional) this function is,
               the greater its positive contribution. The purpose of this paper
               is to develop and test a quick scan purchasing maturity tool by
               applying a design science research
               method.Design/methodology/approachThe maturity tool is developed
               by applying Hevner's framework for design science research. In
               this framework, foundations drawn from the available knowledge
               base are used to develop the new tool. Scientific justification
               of this new tool and approval of its approach for construction
               practice is obtained through testing it in the specific context
               of a case company.FindingsThe tool provides a company with
               insight into its current level of purchasing maturity and

               is industrialized house-building. The aim of the study presented
               here was to investigate whether industrialized house-building
               characteristics could be a step toward a smart factory for wooden
               house builders. In this paper, ideas of the smart wooden house
               factory are synthesized, and challenges for the single-family
               wooden house builder are identified. The study is founded on
               empirical data from one single-case study. A challenge identified
               was the maturity level of the culture and organization to commit
               to and utilize modern technology and modern working methods. The
               concept of the smart wooden house factory is still in its infancy
               and needs further research.",

  abstract = "Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumptions,
              beliefs, and judgments, and thinking carefully and critically
              about how these influence the research process. The practice of
              reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as researchers and
              how this guides our research. It is central in debates on
              objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations of social
              science research and generated knowledge. Incorporating
              reflexivity in the research process is traditionally recognized as
              one of the most notable differences between qualitative and
              quantitative methodologies. Qualitative research centres and
              celebrates participants’ lived experience, and qualitative
              researchers are readily encouraged to consider how their own
              positionalities inform the research process, forming an important
              part of qualitative research training. Quantitative methodologies
              in social and personality psychology, on the other hand, have
              remained seemingly detached from this level of reflexivity and
              general reflective practises. In this commentary, we, three
              quantitative researchers who have grappled with the compatibility
              of reflexivity with our research, argue that reflexivity has much
              to offer quantitative methodologists, in social and personality
              psychology and beyond. The act of reflexivity prompts researchers
              to acknowledge and centre their positionalities, encourages a more
              thoughtful engagement with every step of the research process, and
              thus, as we argue, contributes to the ongoing reappraisal of
              openness and transparency in psychology. In this paper, we make
              the case for integrating reflexivity across all research
              approaches, before providing a ‘beginner’s guide’ for quantitative
              researchers wishing to engage reflexivity within their work,
              providing concrete recommendations, worked examples, and
              reflexivity prompts.",

                 production of knowledge. Related to qualitative research
                 methods, a variety of approaches have been set forth in the
                 literature using the terms conceptual framework, theoretical
                 framework, paradigm, and epistemology. While these approaches
                 are helpful in their own context, we summarize and distill them
                 in order to build upon the case that a balanced and centered
                 use of the theoretical framework can bolster the qualitative
                 approach. Our project builds on the arguments that epistemology
                 and methodological rigor are essential by adding the notion
                 that the influence of theory permeates almost every aspect of
                 the study—even if the author does not recognize this influence.
                 Compilers of methodological approaches have referred to the use
                 of theory as analogous to a coat closet in which different
                 items can be housed or a lens through which the literature and
                 data in the study are viewed. In this article, we offer an
                 evaluative quadrant for determining the appropriate use of
                 theory in qualitative research and a diagram of the qualitative
                 project that points to the central role of a theoretical
                 framework. We also caution against the overreliance on theory
                 in the event that it begins to limit the ability to see
                 emergent findings in the data.",

              ``Participatory Qualitative Research.'' In recent years there has
              been a resurgence of interest in participatory research
              strategies. The articles in this special issue come from different
              disciplines. Against the background of concrete empirical research
              projects, they address numerous conceptual considerations and
              methodological approaches. After reading the contributions, and
              engaging with the authors' arguments, we were prompted to focus in
              particular on those areas in which further work needs to be done.
              They include, on the one hand, fundamental principles of
              participatory research, such as democratic-theory considerations,
              the concept of ``safe space,'' participation issues, and ethical
              questions. And, on the other hand, we focus on practical research
              considerations regarding the role and tasks of the various
              participants; specific methodological approaches; and quality
              criteria—understood here in the sense of arguments justifying a
              participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a broad discussion
              that does not focus only on participatory research in the narrower
              sense. Because participatory methodology poses certain knowledge-
              and research-related questions in a radical way, it has the
              potential to draw attention to hitherto neglected areas in
              qualitative methodology and to stimulate their further
              development.",

              applications. I shall introduce a new scheme for modes of
              recontextualisation that enables the analysis of the ways in which
              one activity – which might be school mathematics or social
              research or any empirically observed regularity of practice –
              recontextualises the practice of another and I shall also present,
              deploy, and develop an existing scheme – domains of action – in an
              analysis of school mathematics examination papers and in the
              structuring of what I refer to as the esoteric domain. This domain
              is here conceived as a hybrid domain of, first, linguistic and
              extralinguistic resources that are unambiguously mathematical in
              terms of both expression and content and, second, pedagogic theory
              – often tacit – that enables the mathematical gaze onto other
              practices and so recontextualises them. A second and more general
              theme that runs through the paper is the claim that there is
              nothing that is beyond semiosis, that there is nothing to which we
              have direct access, unmediated by interpretation. This state of
              affairs has implications for mathematics education. Specifically,
              insofar as an individual’s mathematical semiotic system is under
              continuous development – the curriculum never being graspable all
              at once – understanding – as a stable semiotic moment – of any
              aspect or object of mathematics is always localised to the
              individual and is at best transient, and the sequencing of such
              moments may well also be more individualised than consistent in
              some correspondence with the sequencing of the curriculum. This
              being the case, a concentration on understanding as a goal may
              well serve to inhibit the pragmatic acquisition and deployment of
              mathematical technologies, which should be the principal aim of
              mathematics teaching and learning. The paper is primarily
              concerned with mathematics education. SAM, however, is a language
              that is available for recruiting and deploying in potentially any
              context as I have attempted to illustrate with some of the

                 delivered using person ('you are clever') or process terms
                 ('you worked hard'). Research suggests that giving people
                 process praise after success can help them deal better with
                 subsequent failures because it attributes outcomes to effort
                 rather than fixed ability. However, research has thus far
                 inadequately addressed how these types of praise compare to
                 receiving no evaluative feedback. AIM: The aim of the present
                 research was to examine the effects of person and process
                 praise compared to a control group where only objective outcome
                 feedback was given. SAMPLES: In Study 1, 145 British school
                 children aged 9-11 years took part. In Study 2, participants
                 were 114 British university students. METHOD: In both studies,
                 participants read three scenarios and were asked to imagine
                 themselves as the main character. In each scenario, they
                 succeeded in an educational task and received either person,
                 process, or no praise. Participants then read two scenarios,
                 where they failed at a task. Following each scenario
                 participants evaluated their performance, affect, and
                 persistence. RESULTS: After one failure, participants who
                 received person praise reacted most negatively on all dependent
                 measures. However, those in the process condition did not
                 differ significantly from those in the control group.
                 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that process feedback may
                 not be inherently positive; instead person feedback seems
                 particularly detrimental.",

               skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach – An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings – The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction workers
               generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications – The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications – The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications – The research suggests
               that workplace training has positive relationship with career
               growth. The results suggest that in the construction industry,
               employees are generally well aware of the importance of workplace
               training in their career development and they largely appreciate
               training as being a critical factor for developing their capacity
               to perform their roles successfully, and to maintain their
               employability. Originality/value – This paper is unique as it
               investigates the current skills gap in both generic and skill
               areas within the construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               So far no work has been undertaken to identify and discusses the

               strategies were derived from previous studies of mother-child and
               experimenter-child interactions in an assisted learning
               situation. One strategy the 'contingent approach' was based
               primarily on theoretical considerations and when used in earlier
               work as a basis for describing and evaluating maternal teaching
               it enabled us to predict how well children taught by their
               mothers would do with a task after instruction. The three other
               strategies are idealised versions of the teaching methods used by
               less successful mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our analysis
               of effective instruction it is possible to predict how well
               children taught by these four different techniques by a trained
               instructor should perform after instruction.The present study
               largely confirms these predictions. In so doing, it strengthens
               the supposition that it was maternal behaviour in the earlier
               work which influenced the children's task abilities and it also
               corroborates various hypotheses about the essential nature of
               effective face-to-face instruction.",

               virtual reality driving simulator capable of conveying haptic and
               visual messages to promote eco-sustainable driving behavior. The
               driving simulator was implemented through the Unity game engine;
               a large street environment, including high-speed and urban
               sections, was created to examine different driving behaviors. The
               hardware setup included a gaming driving seat, equipped with a
               steering wheel and pedals; the virtual scenarios were displayed
               through an Oculus Rift headset to guarantee an immersive
               experience. Haptic stimulation (i.e., vibrations) was delivered
               to the driver through the accelerator pedal, while visual stimuli
               (i.e., icons and colors) were shown on a virtual head-up display.
               The sensory feedbacks were presented both alone and in
               combination, providing information about excessive acceleration
               and speed. Four different virtual scenarios, each one including a
               distracting element (i.e., navigator, rain, call, and traffic),
               were also created. Ten participants tested the simulator. Fuel
               consumption was evaluated by calculating a mean power index (MPI)
               in reference to the sensory feedback presentation; physiological
               reactions and responses to a usability survey were also
               collected. The results revealed that the haptic and visuo-haptic
               feedback were responsible for an MPI reduction, respectively, for
               14\% and 11\% compared with a condition of no feedback
               presentation; while visual feedback alone resulted in an MPI
               increase of 11\%. The efficacy of haptic feedback was also
               accompanied by a more relaxing physiological state of the users,
               compared with the visual stimulation. The system’s usability was
               adequate, although haptic stimuli were rated slightly more
               intrusive than the visual ones. Overall, these preliminary
               results highlight how promising the use of the haptic channel can
               be in communicating and guiding the driver toward a more
               eco-sustainable behavior.",

              mixed reality (AR/MR) are almost exclusively image based. The main
              issue with image-based methods is that they do not scale well and,
              as a consequence, AR/MR applications are mostly limited to
              small-scale room experiences. To tackle the challenge of
              large-scale indoor AR/MR localisation, we propose a novel
              framework for AR/MR localisation based solely on 3D–3D model
              registration. The localisation is performed by an automated
              registration of a low-density model of the surroundings created by
              the device to the existing point cloud of the environment based on
              learning-based keypoint detection and description. Our solution
              takes advantage of recent significant improvements in automated
              coarse-to-fine 3D–3D model registration methods. Unlike the
              existing image-based AR/MR localisation methods, which are
              restricted to small room-sized environments, the proposed 3D
              registration-based approach is applicable to large environments
              and is robust to changes in colour and illumination of the scene.
              We perform extensive testing and analysis of the approach with
              real-world experiments and datasets using a prototype developed
              for the Microsoft HoloLens. Experimental results show high
              localisation reliability and accuracy, with a mean translation
              error of 2.8 cm and a mean rotation error of 0.30°. The method
              performs well in a large-scale environment (300 m2) and shows good
              robustness to changes in scene geometry.",

               in place already. Others believe that DfMA is a new direction to
               future construction. This paper aims to review the development of
               DfMA in manufacturing and its status quo in construction, and
               clarify its similarities and differences to other concepts. A
               multi-step research method is adopted in this study: First, an
               analytical framework is generated; Secondly, a literature review
               is conducted on DfMA in general, and DfMA-like concepts in the
               AEC industry; The third step is to compare DfMA with related
               concepts. This study reveals that DfMA as a philosophy is hardly
               new in construction, and the empirical implementation of many
               DfMA guidelines has begun in the AEC industry. The findings

              proved that a game-like platform combined with BIM could provide
              simplified data delivery to a client, leading to customer
              satisfaction, confidence and increased sales. The designed
              workflow and templates were tested in the case study of a small
              self-build construction company. The staff was trained to provide
              BIM data correctly and use supplied game templates. The case study
              demonstrated that automation of the VR House Configurator creation
              is achievable. The study's outcome is an integrated solution to
              regenerate BIM models in the game environment and utilise the
              house configurator's organised furniture library and costing
              interface. Furthermore, the usability tests confirmed the
              applicability, practicability, and validity of the developed
              framework and tools to deal with the revealed challenges in the
              self-build sector. Finally, the research provided a fresh approach
              for the companies in the sector, a step-by-step guide for
              implementing the innovative changes, and detailed descriptions of
              the methodologies and workflows.",

               the performance of construction project delivery. While the
               construction industry is often labeled as conservative and
               unimaginative with regard to technology adoption, significant
               strides have been made in recent years  specifically, the use of
               Building Information Modeling (BIM) for information storage,
               distribution and communication, as well as Lean construction
               techniques such as production planning and control (PPC). While
               the implementation of these innovative technologies and practices
               individually improve project performance, integrating them
               together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is certainly
               useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to the paradox:
               how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a 2D space?
               Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology that can help
               address this challenge. AR is both an aggregator of information
               and an information publishing platform which allows users a
               spectrum of capabilities to 1) passively view displayed
               information, 2) actively engage and interact with published
               content, and 3) collaborate with others in real time from remote
               locations. No extant research effort has comprehensively
               investigated the opportunities and benefits of the integrated use
               of AR, BIM, and Lean in the planning process to improve project
               performance. This paper addresses precisely this research gap.
               Using insights gained from real-world construction projects, this
               paper examines the current state of production strategy process
               (PSP) development  an integral part of PPC, identifies
               pain-points and opportunities for process re-engineering using
               AR, and develops an AR-enabled PSP future state.",

               to decompose the representation of a hierarchical task into its
               component levels so that the representational properties at each
               level can be independently examined. The theoretical framework
               and the methodology are used to analyze the hierarchical

                 However, there have been challenges in quantifying improvements
                 from the conventional method, which leads to the low uptake.
                 The concept of a digital twin (DT) is useful for OSM, which
                 enables production to be represented virtually and visually
                 including all activities associated with it, resources, and
                 workflow involved. Thus, essential information in the product
                 development process such as cost, time, waste, and
                 environmental impacts can be assessed. However, the data
                 required to have accurate results and better-informed
                 decision-making come from heterogeneous data formats (i.e.
                 spread-sheets and BIM models) and across different domains. The
                 inclusion of semantic web technologies such as Linked Data (LD)
                 and Web Ontology Language (OWL) models has proven to better
                 address these challenges especially in terms of
                 interoperability and unambiguous knowledge sys-tematisation.
                 Through an extensive systematic literature review followed up
                 by a case study, an ontology knowledge structure representing
                 the production workflow for OSM is developed. A real-life use

               the grain of wider austerity measures, invested heavily in the
               apprenticeship system. The majority of apprentices are, and have
               historically been, employed within small businesses. However,
               research suggests that, in the main, small firms tend to approach
               management issues ? including workplace employee development ? in
               a less formal way than their larger counterparts. What
               implications this has for apprentices and their workplace

               and it does so through a qualitative study of apprentices in
               three English engineering firms of different sizes. The findings
               broadly support the established picture of informal working and
               learning processes in the small firm. However, it is argued that
               this does not inevitably restrict apprentices? on-the-job
               learning. Rather, the ways in which apprentices learn, and what
               they learn, are conditioned by the interaction ? or

               Bernstein?s conceptual language, and Moore's Bernstein-based
               model of education where vocational learners, plausibly, receive
               an orientation towards broad futures beyond narrow job roles.
               Moore's model implies fundamental changes of all these ?adjusting
               screws? and, importantly, of the principle underlying their
               realisation in schools. The case of company-based education in
               Germany?s ?dual system? is advanced as a real-life example for
               the highly theoretical model. Findings from a Bernsteinian
               analysis of the transmitter-acquirer-relation in regulated
               company transmission made sense, when the system was understood
               as realising the principles envisioned in Moore?s model. The
               model and its underlying principles, together with their
               realisation in the DS, open up a perspective towards education
               (instead of job training) in workplaces.",

               and training should prepare (future) workers by providing a basis
               for lifelong learning in developing both routine and flexible
               competence. The question is whether workplace learning in initial
               VET contributes to this aim. To describe WPL processes and
               outcomes in the Dutch senior VET context, we apply a further
               elaboration of a comprehensive workplace learning theory,
               comprising a cognitive, a social and an emotional dimension.
               Qualitative case studies show that various factors in the
               different dimensions of learning influence the learning processes
               and outcomes in a diverse way. Especially more profound
               acquisition and development of abstract principles relating to
               flexible competence does not automatically take place during WPL.

                 is to explain how healthcare professionals (can) contribute to
                 the effectiveness of MDT, through the use of activity theory
                 (collective work activity shared by others who are motivated by
                 a purpose mediated by tools in order to achieve a specific
                 goal) and the associated idea of knotworking (method of tying,
                 untying, and retying together seemingly separate threads of
                 activity). The leading thesis here is that MDTs benefit from
                 health professionals with well-established leadership skills,
                 and also strong collaborative skills that enable them to
                 transition fluidly between leadership roles as needed to
                 advance patient care. Within activity theory, knotworking is
                 the process of tying and untying various threads of activity
                 and knowledge from across the MDT in order to accomplish
                 specific objectives over time. Knotworking exemplifies the
                 dynamic nature of MDT collaboration, which requires
                 professionals to be productive in their environment. The
                 viewpoints offered in this editorial contribute to a new
                 perspective on MDTs, one that acknowledges distributed

               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the published
               research on apprenticeship training that is specifically focused
               on the construction sector, to determine the current status quo
               and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approachA systematic review approach
               was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using SCOPUS
               databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified and
               analysed.FindingsIt was found that monitoring and control is the
               most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth of
               studies that has focused on apprentices training in developing
               countries.Research limitations/implicationsThe gaps identified in
               the current knowledge on apprenticeship training would serve as a
               justification for future investigations. However, the scope of
               the review is limited to papers published in academic journals
               and citable through SCOPUS.Practical implicationsThe outcomes of
               the study provide researchers and other relevant stakeholders
               with a concise report on the findings of previous studies. It
               also provides insight into strategies for improving the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training in the construction
               sector.Originality/valueA systematic evaluation of the extant
               literature draws on theoretical evidence and highlights the
               factors that are more likely to influence the outcomes of
               apprentice training for craftspeople in the construction sector.",

  abstract    = "CONTEXT: As a contribution to the State of the Science issue on
                 'The problem with solutions', this paper discusses how
                 technology-mediated and assumedly simple and straightforward
                 solutions to professional problems in fact require extensive
                 work from professionals in order that generalised tools and
                 procedures can be made sense of, adapted and employed in local
                 practice. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE: The authors introduce a
                 perspective on epistemic practices in professional work and
                 learning in order to conceptualise and discuss the diversity of
                 the knowledge-related actions required to perform professional
                 services. They discuss how the growing numbers and diversity of
                 knowledge-generating actors who aspire to inform professional
                 practice create 'multi-charged' work settings, imbued with
                 multiple objectives and purposes. This development presents new
                 epistemic challenges to professionals, which require extended
                 capacities for knowledge work. SUMMARY: The authors give
                 examples from empirical studies conducted in Nordic health care
                 settings, which relate to nurses' engagement with repositories
                 of clinical procedures and to the development of new medical
                 technologies for clinical use. They show how work performance
                 in both cases depends on a range of epistemic practices (ie,
                 collective ways of exploring, assessing, critically examining
                 and justifying knowledge claims), which are necessary if the
                 general tools and technologies are to be put to work in the
                 local environment. This forms a core dynamic in practitioners'
                 work-based learning as it moves between what is known and what
                 remains to be explored or improved. CONCLUSIONS: The paper
                 argues that the widespread belief in simple or versatile
                 solutions is challenged by research that reveals the diversity
                 of the knowledge practices needed to perform professional
                 services. The paper suggests that professional communities
                 might pay more attention to epistemic practices as means to
                 handle complexity. It raises intriguing questions and discusses
                 implications for medical education.",

               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and policies
               of vocational education and training (VET). With contributions
               from a panel of leading international scholars, the Handbook
               contains 27 authoritative essays from a wide range of
               disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis of
               the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most recent
               research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book explores
               the key debates about the role of VET in the education and
               training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals how
               expertise is developed in an age of considerable transformation
               in work processes, work organization, and occupational
               identities. The authors also examine many of the challenges of
               vocational education and training such as the impact of digital
               technologies on employment, the demand for (re)training in the
               context of extended working lives, the emergence of learning
               regions and skill ecosystems, and the professional development of
               vocational teachers and trainers. This important text: Offers an
               original view of VET’s role in both the initial and continuing

               organised, the organisational context, and learning in the
               workplace. It develops, in part, from earlier work where we
               argued that organisations differ in the way they create and
               manage themselves as learning environments, with some
               conceptualised as expansive in the sense that their employees
               experience diverse forms of participation and, hence, are more
               likely to foster learning at work (see Fuller and Unwin, 2004).
               The paper argues that contemporary workplaces give rise to many
               different forms of learning, some of which is utilised to the
               benefit of the organisation and employees (though not,
               necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but much of which is buried
               within everyday workplace activity. By studying the way in which
               work is organised (including the organisation of physical and
               virtual spaces), it is possible to expose some of this learning
               activity as well as examples of the creation of new (or refined)
               knowledge. Part of this process involves the breaking down of
               conceptual hierarchies that presuppose that learning is
               restricted to certain types of employee and/or parts of an
               organisation. This paper builds on the work of other researchers
               who highlight the importance of the context (see, inter alia,
               Nonaka et al, 2005; Boreham and Morgan, 2004; Unwin et al 2005).
               It also draws on the work of Engestrom (see, inter alia, 2001),
               who has highlighted the way new knowledge is created through
               employee interaction when problem solving and, hence, has paid
               attention to the important question of the quality of learning in
               the workplace. In addition, it builds on Wilkinsons (2002)
               conceptualisation of the way organisations construct, manage and
               respond to social relations of production that operate at a
               variety of levels in productive systems. The paper uses evidence
               from the learning as work project, which is based in public and
               private sector organisations in the UK.",

               reasons, because they are active in the learning process.
               Furthermore, the results show that the learners achieve knowledge
               about a systematical treatment of COPD patients. However, they do
               not experience that they transfer this knowledge into altered
               ways of treating the patients. It is discussed why VR-based
               learning particularly underpins active participation and why the
               learners do not transfer knowledge into practice. It is concluded
               that VR-based learning should include systematic reflection.",

               leverage human expertise. Working towards these goals, a
               master-apprentice model is presented and is evaluated during a
               grasping task for effectiveness and human perception. The
               apprenticeship model augments self-supervised learning with
               learning by demonstration, efficiently using the human's time and
               expertise while facilitating future scalability to supervision of
               multiple robots; the human provides demonstrations via virtual
               reality when the robot cannot complete the task autonomously.
               Experimental results indicate that the robot learns a grasping
               task with the apprenticeship model faster than with a solely
               self-supervised approach and with fewer human interventions than
               a solely demonstration-based approach; 100\% grasping success is
               obtained after 150 grasps with 19 demonstrations. Preliminary
               user studies evaluating workload, usability, and effectiveness of
               the system yield promising results for system scalability and
               deployability. They also suggest a tendency for users to

               intersection of the physical and digital, and in the blurring of
               their previously clear dividing lines. Multispace is not a single
               space, but a hybrid space where, in effect, we occupy multiple
               spaces simultaneously. We enter it on a Zoom call, when we are in
               our office and in a meeting with 20 people; when we are cycling
               down a country lane whilst racing against thousands of others who
               also use the Strava app; when we are watching a TV show while
               live tweeting; or, perhaps most literally, when wandering around
               the local park looking for creatures that only appear on a
               smartphone screen. A fundamental question of this AD is why the
               phenomena that multispace describes are of concern to architects.
               The answer is that multispace points to a situation that is at
               root an architectural one. Offering both a collective and highly
               personalised experience, static and dynamically customisable, and

               the centre of a set of tensions, concerns and preoccupations at

               empirically understand how various dimensions of technology,

               the lifelike-utilitarian robot user. The results show that
               human–robot peering may be a fundamental solution to increase
               user acceptance. By testing the effect of user characteristics,
               we also discover a lifelike-utilitarian type of robot that is
               more appealing to female AEC stakeholders. The study contributes
               to the construction robotics literature by providing tailored
               design and implementation strategies. It points to future
               research avenues such as user experience and social factors for
               exploring the impact of robotics and artificial intelligence in

              mass customization to increase product efficiency without
              sacrificing design flexibility. Effective implementation of mass
              customization can be done through a product platform, i.e. a
              configurator. However, existing configurators often lack
              integration of knowledge from the downstream supply chain such as
              manufacturing. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for a
              configurator unified through a manufacturing kit-of-parts.
              Kit-of-parts are pre-engineered and pre-designed digital models
              representing fabrication-ready components. Using production rules
              and restraints, accurate planning and design representations can
              be derived and utilized in the configurator. This research
              develops a configurator prototype using three-tier architecture.
              The prototype supports a low-to-high level of detail of
              kit-of-parts. It integrates product platforms and project
              development across multiple building phases including site
              planning, floor plan layout, and 3D model generation. Finally, the
              implementation of a modular building configurator illustrates the

               Systematic review and network meta-analysis. Methods Screening,
               data extraction, coding, and risk of bias assessment were
               performed independently and in duplicate. Bayesian arm based,
               multilevel network meta-analyses were performed for the primary
               analyses. Quality of the evidence for each arm was graded using
               the confidence in network meta-analysis (CINeMA) online tool.
               Data sources Cochrane Library, Medline, Embase, SPORTDiscus, and
               PsycINFO databases. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies
               Any randomised trial with exercise arms for participants meeting
               clinical cut-offs for major depression. Results 218 unique
               studies with a total of 495 arms and 14 170 participants were
               included. Compared with active controls (eg, usual care, placebo
               tablet), moderate reductions in depression were found for walking
               or jogging (n=1210, κ=51, Hedges’ g −0.62, 95\% credible interval
               −0.80 to −0.45), yoga (n=1047, κ=33, g −0.55, −0.73 to −0.36),
               strength training (n=643, κ=22, g −0.49, −0.69 to −0.29), mixed
               aerobic exercises (n=1286, κ=51, g −0.43, −0.61 to −0.24), and
               tai chi or qigong (n=343, κ=12, g −0.42, −0.65 to −0.21). The
               effects of exercise were proportional to the intensity
               prescribed. Strength training and yoga appeared to be the most
               acceptable modalities. Results appeared robust to publication
               bias, but only one study met the Cochrane criteria for low risk
               of bias. As a result, confidence in accordance with CINeMA was
               low for walking or jogging and very low for other treatments.
               Conclusions Exercise is an effective treatment for depression,
               with walking or jogging, yoga, and strength training more
               effective than other exercises, particularly when intense. Yoga
               and strength training were well tolerated compared with other
               treatments. Exercise appeared equally effective for people with
               and without comorbidities and with different baseline levels of
               depression. To mitigate expectancy effects, future studies could
               aim to blind participants and staff. These forms of exercise
               could be considered alongside psychotherapy and antidepressants
               as core treatments for depression. Systematic review registration

  abstract  = "Purpose This paper aims to evaluate the existing and emerging
               Offsite Construction (OSC) skills. Construction industry is
               inherently labour oriented, fashioning poor labour productivity,
               low sustainability, slow and costly processes. These shortcomings
               promote OSC alongside driving forces such as industrialisation,
               automation and digitalisation. However, the traditional
               construction skills are not on par with the complexity, where
               robots, co-bots and digital-driven automated systems create the
               need for novel OSC skills. Design/methodology/approach Data
               collection is executed through a Roundtable activity hosting
               Construction Management academics form Australian universities
               specialising in construction technology. They engaged in ranking
               of skills along with creating a word cloud for the question,
               “what are the future construction skills that will be more
               beneficial in an OSC platform?” Word cloud is reviewed in a
               discussion approach while skills ranking data is analysed using
               descriptive statistics. Findings The most prominent OSC skills
               are logistics manager, project manager and digital producer.
               Attributes of skills that come under construction trades workers,
               design, engineering and specialist professionals will vary based
               on onsite-offsite percentage combination in a construction
               project. Study reviews the required construction skills at two
               ends of a continuum featuring the trade-based skills; bricklayer,
               concreter and carpenter at one end (traditional build) and the
               heavily digitalised and automated skills at the other end (OSC).
               The noticeable transition towards OSC urges industry
               practitioners, policy-makers and education providers to focus on
               understanding and cultivating key OSC skills. Originality/value
               This study describes the transition of skills from onsite to OSC.
               It is presented as one of the earliest attempts to evaluate OSC

  abstract  = "Purpose The construction industry is currently responding to
               pressures of industrialisation happening across all sectors.
               Consequently, offsite construction (OSC) has become a vehicle to
               achieve industrialisation. This requires changes in traditional
               construction processes resulting in possible changes in
               construction skill requirements. Accordingly, the purpose of this
               study is to identify and review prevailing OSC practices and
               skills in the Australian construction industry. This study aims
               to critically analyse the existing skill profile classifications
               through a single case study and identify the need for an OSC
               specific skill classification. Design/methodology/approach This
               study follows a case study design, with an in-depth analysis of a
               single construction project. Only one case study was studied
               because scientifically, one example was enough to prove that the
               prevailing skill classifications do not represent OSC skills in a
               modern context. Data was retrospectively collected through
               semi-structured interviews of project stakeholders representing
               design, manufacture and assembly. Content analysis was conducted
               to analyse the collected data and produce findings. Findings This
               study identifies the inadequacy of the existing classification
               system, unavailability and the need of OSC specific skill
               categorisation. It highlights new skills that enter OSC; building
               information modelling engineer, three-dimensional draftsperson,
               OSC project manager and project coordinator, which are not
               identified in the available Australian skill classifications.
               These, together with existing skills need to be carved in to
               create a new skill classification. Originality/value This study
               is the first of its kind where a comprehensive OSC project is
               evaluated as a case study to determine OSC skill classification
               requirements in Australia.",

              and other types of technological changes on labor demand, and use
              it to interpret changes in US employment over the recent past. At
              the center of our framework is the allocation of tasks to capital
              and labor—the task content of production. Automation, which
              enables capital to replace labor in tasks it was previously
              engaged in, shifts the task content of production against labor
              because of a displacement effect. As a result, automation always
              reduces the labor share in value added and may reduce labor demand
              even as it raises productivity. The effects of automation are
              counterbalanced by the creation of new tasks in which labor has a
              comparative advantage. The introduction of new tasks changes the
              task content of production in favor of labor because of a
              reinstatement effect, and always raises the labor share and labor
              demand. We show how the role of changes in the task content of
              production—due to automation and new tasks—can be inferred from
              industry-level data. Our empirical decomposition suggests that the
              slower growth of employment over the last three decades is
              accounted for by an acceleration in the displacement effect,
              especially in manufacturing, a weaker reinstatement effect, and
              slower growth of productivity than in previous decades.",

               resource development (HRD) that many contemporary managers and

               seek ways in which to build workforce capacity. It can be
               dismissed as an anachronism in the light of the emergent
               discourse about the so-called knowledge economy and knowledge
               workers, as well as calls for greater occupational boundary
               crossing and multi-disciplinary/multi-skilled approaches to work.
               Knowledge workers are presumed to enter the workplace fully
               formed, armed with theoretical knowledge and (possibly) some work
               experience from their university degrees. In contrast,

               education and training (IVET) paradigm and as a journey towards
               intermediate level expertise. Hence, for some, apprenticeship is
               an institutional arrangement between the state, employers and
               (sometimes) trades unions to train young people. For others,
               apprenticeship has echoes of a medieval world of individual

               who earned a living from their skills and formed guilds to

               can positively impact learning. Alleged benefits include
               increased usability, improved engagement and collaboration among
               students, and enhanced perception of tasks, particularly spatial

               training for carpenter apprentices. The learning objectives focus
               on spatial skills, particularly the mapping between 2D and 3D
               representations. We examine (1) whether TUIs can support the
               training of spatial skills and, if so, what features enable them
               to do so, and (2) what kinds of classroom pedagogical scenarios

               Academic Book Week (UK) in 2017, and in 2011 was placed on Time
               Magazine's top 100 non-fiction books written in English since
               1923. Reissued with a fresh Introduction by the Nobel-prize
               winner Paul Krugman and a new Afterword by Keynes’ biographer
               Robert Skidelsky, this important work is made available to a new
               generation. The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money
               transformed economics and changed the face of modern
               macroeconomics. Keynes’ argument is based on the idea that the
               level of employment is not determined by the price of labour, but
               by the spending of money. It gave way to an entirely new approach
               where employment, inflation and the market economy are concerned.
               Highly provocative at its time of publication, this book and
               Keynes’ theories continue to remain the subject of much support
               and praise, criticism and debate. Economists at any stage in
               their career will enjoy revisiting this treatise and observing

                 human well-being and provides a foundation for other rights,
                 including rights to health, education, water and sanitation,
                 freedom of association and freedom of expression, and the right
                 to life itself. It is one of the underlying key capabilities,
                 which Amartya Sen argues is required for opportunities to be
                 harnessed (Sen 1985). The United Nations has determined that
                 the right to adequate housing should not be interpreted
                 narrowly, such as being limited to having shelter or viewed
                 exclusively as a commodity, but rather it is to be understood
                 in a far broader sense: the right to live in peace, security
                 and dignity (UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
                 Rights 1991). Realising this right in practice, however,
                 requires new thinking and new policies. The stark reality is
                 that we are a long way from achieving this goal. Our paper
                 suggests that to make this ambition real, we must bring a human
                 rights approach together with new economic thinking and
                 mission-oriented—outcomes-driven— economic policies. These
                 frameworks can reinforce one another. While the former invokes
                 legal accountability for ensuring adequate housing for all in
                 support of human flourishing, the latter organises and
                 accelerates the multi-stakeholder, whole-of-government action
                 required to meet this obligation. The United Nations
                 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) of achieving ‘access for all
                 to adequate, safe and affordable housing’ (SDG 11.1) can
                 provide a north star orientation for this new policy approach.
                 But achieving it requires unpicking the relationships between
                 current actors. It requires governments to set bold missions
                 that catalyse cross-sectoral investment and collaboration, to
                 embrace their role as market-shapers, to align public sector
                 tools, institutions and finance with these missions, and to
                 design partnerships – including with the private sector – that

               more domains, leveraging rapid advances in other technologies and
               driving soaring stock prices. Yet measured productivity growth
               has declined by half over the past decade, and real income has
               stagnated since the late 1990s for most Americans. We describe
               four potential explanations for this clash of expectations and
               statistics: false hopes, mismeasurement, redistribution and
               implementation lags. While a case can be made for each
               explanation, we argue that lags have likely been the biggest
               contributor to the paradox. The most impressive capabilities of
               AI, particularly those based on machine learning, have not yet
               diffused widely. More importantly, like other general purpose
               technologies, their full effects won’t be realized until waves of
               complementary innovations are developed and implemented. The
               adjustment costs, organizational changes, and new skills needed
               for successful AI can be modeled as a kind of intangible capital.
               Some of the value of this intangible capital is already reflected
               in the market value of firms. However, going forward, national

  abstract = "This thesis describes the results of research aimed at exploring
              the relationship between three different practices to improve
              product development: Concurrent Engineering (CE), New Product
              Development (NPD), and Project Management (PM). The literature on
              each approach is abundant, yet studies explaining their
              inter-relationship are scanty and contradictory. Therefore, the
              main contribution of this thesis is explanation and clarification
              of contradictory theories and perspectives. In exploring this
              relationship four cases studies were developed in companies that
              were applying these practices. Principles of the grounded theory
              and qualitative research were applied to gather and analyse data.
              The results suggest that CE, NPD, and PM are relatively different
              in practice and purpose and therefore they can be complementary to
              each other. However, because of a lack of clearer definitions and
              boundaries they are sometimes considered competing approaches, as
              has been observed both in the literature and in practice. CE, NPD,
              and PM were difficult to perceive as a sub-component one of the
              other as has been suggested in the literature. Rather,
              inter-linked process models seemed to better explain how the
              inter-relationship was understood and applied. The data gathered
              from the case studies suggest cause-effect relationships that may
              guide practitioners to implement or improve their product
              development practices. The investigation explores the essence,
              purpose and the knowledge generation process of CE, NPD and PM. It
              is suggested that NPD has a higher level of maturity than CE and
              NPD. This suggestion and the corresponding discussion is thought
              to be a contribution of current philosophical debates on the
              subject areas thereby nurturing the research agenda.",

              (PMS) to monitor their performance, assess the success of
              strategies, and/or assist the implementation of change programmes
              for continuous improvement. Performance measurement research has
              significantly evolved from developing conceptual frameworks (e.g.
              balanced scorecard) to rethinking and verifying the effects of PMS
              that is contextualised within the organisation. Inspite of
              significant evolution, PMS remains contentious conceptually and
              challenging for practitioners, especially in construction where
              theory and practice face contextual opportunities and constraints.
              While the approaches of key performance indicators (KPIs) and
              project performance benchmarks are predominating in construction
              research and practice, a systematic investigation of the
              conceptual basis of PMS is lacking in the construction context.
              This research examines the challenges for PMS theory and practice.
              Specifically, it aims to provide theoretical verification and
              convincing evidence pertaining to the extent to which key
              attributes of PMS lead to any positive effects in the construction
              context. By conducting a mixed methods research (i.e. a
              questionnaire survey and three case studies in UK construction
              firms), this study finds: three attributes are crucial for
              explicitly anatomising PMS – the nature, process quality and the
              use; all of them can separately lead to positive effects on
              sustaining project management and financial performance of
              construction firms, whereas PMS process quality plays a
              predominant role; both the nature of PMS and PMS process quality
              are the prerequisites of the extant use of PMS, which further
              improves system users’ perceived effectiveness of PMS; and
              finally, both institutional and organisational contexts largely
              shape and affect the adoption of PMS (the nature and process
              quality in particular). This study primarily contributes to
              systematically explicating the conceptual basis and effectiveness
              of PMS in the construction context and thereby uncovering the
              black box of how PMS affects organisational performance in

              management research. However, in the field of construction project
              management, it is relatively under-explored. This is mainly due to
              the different organisational context of Temporary
              Multi-Organisations (TMOs). This research re-explores the notion
              of organisational culture in construction projects. Based on
              Darwin’s theory of evolution this research goes back to the very
              beginning; illustrating the exact meaning and dynamics of
              organisational culture in a construction TMO’s ecosystem. This
              research view an organisation and its forming of culture(s) as
              part of an evolutionary process. Thus, a critical realist’ view of
              causation is used as the foundation of the research design and
              methodology. Case study materials are provided from three
              Alliancing TMOs belonging to two major infrastructure clients in
              the UK. A designer culture model and the institutional theory are
              drawn upon to complement the basis of analysis for evolution. A
              qualitative research method is employed through semi-structured
              interviews and pre- and post-interview meetings. Other supporting

              postulate are generated and examined against the empirical data.
              Findings suggest that (i) the TMOs’ culture evolves through a set
              of recursive stages across the project lifecycle, (ii) the culture
              of the TMO undergoes several lifecycles during one lifespan of the
              project, and (iii) there are some evidence that culture at TMO
              level is learned, rationalised and routinised at corporate level.
              The postulate shows that it is plausible to predict the trajectory
              of how a TMO’s culture will evolve across the project lifecycle
              given a set of organisational features. In practice, findings
              suggest that hard artifacts alone are not able to sustain

              theories from systems thinking and behavioural science in

              Greater awareness of the owner and their supply network
              capabilities to mitigate failure could reduce significant quality
              costs that can amount to many millions of pounds. This thesis
              investigates why assets handed over to the owner have failed
              during operation, and proposes new ways that capabilities can be
              integrated to reduce and prevent potential operational failure
              from arising. An abductive reasoning with a grounded theory
              approach was used over a three-year period, and involved quarterly
              expert research steering group meetings to validate the iteration
              between literature and empirical observation to obtain new
              insights. The first workshop and questionnaire phase of the study
              created a Cost of Quality (COQ) framework; this was then tested on
              five multi-case study and subsequently developed within a single
              expert owner organisation using semi-structured interviews, card
              sorting and a Delphi review. The results show that the owner and
              the multi-organisational supply network capabilities are
              fragmented in addressing operational failure. By identifying and
              measuring quality cost failure, owners and their supply network
              will learn and be able to procure more integrated capabilities in
              failure mitigation for reducing quality cost failure. This will be

              functional operations management capabilities, which is summarised
              in a capabilities cycle model. The model illustrates the need for
              a strategic project and quality management approach to integrate

              integrated capabilities approach is proposed for the owner and its
              multi-organisational supply and operator network to integrate and

              share project risk and quality cost in mitigating the failures.",

  author   = "Almadhoob, Huda Mohamed Ali Hasan Husain",
  abstract = "Managing large infrastructure projects remains a thorny issue in
              theory and practice. This is mainly due to their increasingly
              interconnected, interdependent, multilateral, nonlinear,
              unpredictable, uncontrollable, and rapidly changing nature. This
              study is an attempt to demystify the key issues to the management
              of large construction projects, arguing that these projects are
              delivered through networks that evolve in ways that we do not
              sufficiently understand as yet. The theoretical framework of this
              study is grounded in Complexity Theory; a theory resulted in a
              paradigm shift when it was first introduced to project management
              post-2000 but is yet to be unpacked in its full potential. The
              original contribution of the study is predicated on perceiving
              large construction projects as evolving complex systems that
              involves a high degree of self‐organisation. This is a process
              that transitions contractually static prescribed roles to dynamic
              network roles, comprising individuals exchanging information.
              Furthermore, by placing great emphasis upon informal
              communications, this study demonstrates how self-organising
              networks can be married with Complexity Theory. This approach has
              the potential to make bedfellows around the concept of managing
              networks within a context of managing projects; a concept that is
              not always recognised, especially in project management. With the
              help of social network analysis, two snapshots from Bank Station
              Capacity Upgrade Project Network were analysed as a case study.
              Findings suggest that relationships and hence network structures
              in large construction projects exhibit small-world topology,
              underlined by a high degree of sparseness and clustering. These
              are distinct structural properties of self-organising networks.
              Evidence challenges the theorisation about self-organisation which
              largely assumes positive outcomes and suggests that
              self-organising could open up opportunities yet also create
              constraints. This helps to provide further insights into
              complexity and the treatment of uncertainty in large projects. The

              procurement with Design, Bid, Build delivery was combined with
              standards and guidance; (2) dysfunctional integration – where the
              adoption of Private Finance Initiative (PFI) with Design and Build
              delivery transferred traditional roles and reduced
              standardisation; (3 and 4) adaptive integration 1 and 2 – which
              saw both a gradual deregulation of standards; and, an
              understanding for standards, and (5) the fifth temporal
              disintegration period – where guidance from the wider delivery
              model ceased to be updated due to top down policy reorganisation
              and lack of centralised control and includes a current case study.
              Throughout these temporal periods, it was found that the national
              delivery models have had a significant influence on hospital

              address complexity and uncertainty that emerge in project
              operations. Amongst various built environment innovations,
              Building Information Modelling (BIM) is prominently chosen by the
              built environment organisations. This innovation presents a great
              challenge for Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). It
              renders existing working paradigms obsolete and digitally
              transforms built environment businesses. The lack of individuals
              with adequate BIM competence is a major problem. Project-Based
              Learning (PBL) is a potential solution. This research aims to
              investigate BIM learning in projects in the built environment
              SMEs. The study examines knowledge practices used in projects and
              how they are exercised together in forming a project-based
              learning mechanism of BIM. 31 designers and engineers from the
              British and the Thai design and engineering SME consultancies are
              interviewed. Knowledge practices are identified based on their
              significance, while associations between them are analysed.
              Informal meeting, Knowledge team creation, and Standardisation
              play a crucial role in BIM learning in projects. Informal meeting
              and Knowledge team creation relate to tacit knowledge learning and
              exploration. Standardisation encourages explicit knowledge
              learning and exploitation. A project-based learning mechanism of
              BIM is formed through an interconnected system of knowledge
              practices. The connections among knowledge practices are found as
              assistive and correlative. The project-based learning mechanisms
              of BIM identified within this research are ambidextrous through
              the variety of knowledge practices being exercised together.
              Additionally, they can be further categorised as Exploitative,
              Ambidextrous, and Explorative. Practical suggestions are provided
              for BIM managers to increase attention towards the employment of
              certain knowledge practices and the creation of project-based
              learning mechanisms of BIM. Informal meeting, Knowledge team
              creation, and Standardisation are recommended for managers of BIM
              and other innovations. Innovation managers can balance
              ambidexterity by utilising an array of knowledge practices to
              encourage both exploitation and exploration. Proactive and
              tangible support such as the implementation of guidelines and
              protocols from the public sector in developing countries will
              promote BIM learning in organisations and encourage industry-wide

  abstract = "Optimism bias affects most estimation based human decisions, from
              daily activities to the appraisal of big infrastructure projects.
              Building upon the underlying constructs of this behaviour through
              the lenses of support and prospect theories, operationalised in
              the internal and external view in the project management context,
              helped me to formulate a conceptual framework. This framework,
              called the “Holistic view” suggests ways to integrate the two
              perspectives with the aim to improve the quality of forecasts in
              infrastructure management. Integration can be achieved by
              including subjective probabilities and unpacking techniques into
              case-based reasoning methods. Based on this framework and on the
              analysis of the relevant policies, perspectives, definitions and
              techniques provided by the literature on optimism bias in project
              forecasting, I designed and administered four experiments, with a
              sample of 231 participants. The results of the first experiment
              show that there is a positive relationship between different
              levels of dispositional optimism and resource overruns. In the
              second experiment, I found that adding an optimism uplift to an
              estimate structurally increases forecast precision, however, this
              might lead to the use of more resources than when optimism uplift
              is not applied. In the third experiment, I found that unpacking,
              whilst making estimations slightly more precise, does not
              influence the estimations as in the previous case, but only the
              estimator. The results of the fourth experiment, combining
              unpacking with optimism uplift, indicated that forecast precision
              starkly increased, supporting the adoption of an “Holistic view”.
              This research shows the relevance of experimental methods in
              project management, unveils new relationships between different
              perspectives in the project forecasting field, and analyses, net
              of other factors, the impact of forecasting tools integrated in
              some of the policies addressing the effect of optimism bias in

              addition to DfMA guidelines and digital-enabled approaches. For
              this research, a mixed method was used. Questionnaires defined the
              context of Huoshenshan Hospital, namely the healthcare
              construction in China. Then, Huoshenshan Hospital provided a case
              study of the first emergency hospital which addressed the
              uncertainty of COVID-19. This extreme project, a 1,000-bed
              hospital built in 10 days, implemented DfMA in healthcare
              construction and provides an opportunity to examine the use of
              modularity. A workshop with a design institution provided basic
              facts and insight into past practice and was followed by
              interviews with 18 designers, from various design disciplines, who
              were involved in the project. Finally, multiple archival materials
              were used as secondary data sources. It was found that complexity
              hinders building systems integration, while reinforcement
              relationships between multiple dimensions of modularity (across
              organisation-process-product-supply chain dimensions) are the
              underlying mechanism that allows for the reduction of complexity
              and the integration of building systems. Promoting integrated
              approaches to DfMA relies on adjusting and coupling
              multi-dimensional modular reinforcement relationships (namely,
              relationships of modular alignment, modular complement, and
              modular incentive). Thus, the building systems integrator can use
              these three approaches to increase the success of digital-enabled

  abstract = "Large, or mega, construction project organisations are temporary
              in nature and traditionally structured around a life cycle model
              consisting of predefined, time bound sequential stages of work
              that are designed to process information and reduce uncertainty.
              Yet as organising through projects becomes both more prevalent and
              challenging, it could be argued that such a model constrains our
              understanding and representation of what ‘actually’ happens beyond
              these deterministic structures and prescriptive routines,
              specifically in understanding ‘how’ construction project
              organisations transition through the predefined time boundaries of

              through empirically investigating the ‘transition’ between life
              cycle stages, with ‘incomplete’ information. It identifies a five

              the underlying generative mechanisms involved in the (re)creation
              of organisational routines in managing the incompleteness
              associated with transitioning from one life cycle stage to the

              sought to transition from its design stage, through formal
              sanction, and into its construction stage. Informed ontologically
              by process metaphysics, and through challenging the underlying
              theoretical temporal assumptions of temporary organisations -
              ‘newness’, and organisational routines - ‘repetition’, it
              describes managing project transitions as ‘dialogical action’,
              influenced by the spatiotemporal aspects of the organising
              inquiry. It identifies the patterning of action within six
              transition routines, that when mapped over time present the five
              stage recursive process model of transition. Despite a successful
              three-year relationship in developing organisational capability
              between the client and the contractor in the design stage, as the
              pre-defined date for the commencement of the construction stage
              neared, there emerged a realisation of the impending uncertainty
              that this new stage would bring. Triggered by various formal and
              informal transition ‘rituals’, the organisations’ search for, and
              assumptions about the ‘sufficient completeness’, or ‘necessary
              incompleteness’ of information led to both the effortful and
              emergent (re)creation in the ‘patterning of dialogic action’ from
              the design stage, into the construction stage.",

               Strategies",

  abstract  = "The aim of this thesis is to propose a new approach to the
               analysis and visualisation of reforms in procurement and project
               management systems within the UK construction industry. The
               subject matter chosen was inspired by the publication of the
               Latham Report (Latham, 1994) and personal experience within the
               construction industry within one of the roles currently in
               transition. Certain limitations within existing methodologies
               employed by those who have sought to analyse construction
               procurement and management (for example, Higgin and Jessop, 1965;
               Masterman, 1992; Franks, 1998 and Cleland and King, 1983), are
               identified. These limitations are associated with the
               interdependence of roles, appropriateness of detail, uniformity
               of presentation and the difficulty of quantification in the
               context of a non-linear, complex, iterative, interactive,
               non-hierarchical process that construction comprises.
               Conceptually the research draws together Winch's model of the
               construction project team as a temporary project coalition
               (Winch, 1983:36) and Williamson's nexus of treaties (in Aoki,
               1992:1). The research proposes that current dramatic changes in
               procurement and management strategies might be observed and
               analysed if the construction project is conceptualised as a
               network of relationships existing between the firms that comprise
               the project coalition. These relationships are contractual, those
               associated with performance incentives and those associated with
               information exchanges (the latter classified into the main
               functions that the project team must perform - design
               development, cost and progress management). It is proposed that
               social network analysis (SNA) be used to investigate these
               networks. Following a pilot study involving the BAA ``Genesis''
               project, four case studies were carried out. Two control studies
               involved traditional procurement; a further two represented
               projects utilising partnering, supply chain management and work
               clusters, and involving two of the UK's largest and most
               innovative clients. Analysis of the data focussed upon the use of
               centrality (a measure of prominence within a network), as a means
               of quantifying changing roles within the coalition and the
               relationships between the firms providing these roles. The
               research established that SNA is a very effective tool for
               research into procurement and management. Findings suggest that
               the changing prominence of existing roles and the evolution of
               certain hybrid roles are readily quantified and graphically
               represented using SNA; centrality is ideally suited to look into
               the leverage that project actors exert within the construction
               project supply chain; findings challenge some existing views on
               the desirability and nature of fragmentation within the UK
               construction industry; findings also suggest that the two new
               procurement projects deal with the governance of their respective
               coalitions in very different ways; a single, prominent actor is
               needed to manage the supply chain; traditional construction roles
               are changing rapidly - cost management, design dislocation and
               the new role of cluster leader are all important issues.",

               support KES in complex production contexts. Our results suggest
               that the proposed system not only changes the perception of the

               element of it. The results also reveal changes in the employees’
               focus of attention when working with the AR-aid in question and
               how they individually adapt to it. Moreover, our findings suggest
               that the proposed system facilitates a change in the proximity
               between experts and non-experts, bridging spatial and temporal
               distances, fostering cooperation between those two categories of
               workers, at the same time that enhance their autonomy. Overall,

  abstract      = "Given the rapid adoption of generative AI and its potential
                   to impact a wide range of tasks, understanding the effects of
                   AI on the economy is one of society's most important
                   questions. In this work, we take a step toward that goal by
                   analyzing the work activities people do with AI, how
                   successfully and broadly those activities are done, and
                   combine that with data on what occupations do those
                   activities. We analyze a dataset of 200k anonymized and
                   privacy-scrubbed conversations between users and Microsoft
                   Bing Copilot, a publicly available generative AI system. We
                   find the most common work activities people seek AI
                   assistance for involve gathering information and writing,
                   while the most common activities that AI itself is performing
                   are providing information and assistance, writing, teaching,
                   and advising. Combining these activity classifications with
                   measurements of task success and scope of impact, we compute
                   an AI applicability score for each occupation. We find the
                   highest AI applicability scores for knowledge work occupation
                   groups such as computer and mathematical, and office and
                   administrative support, as well as occupations such as sales
                   whose work activities involve providing and communicating
                   information. Additionally, we characterize the types of work
                   activities performed most successfully, how wage and
                   education correlate with AI applicability, and how real-world
                   usage compares to predictions of occupational AI impact.",

  abstract  = "What does “transforming” construction mean? – Where is it, who is
               doing the transforming, and how (and when) do we know it is
               happening? In Construction Management and Economics and
               elsewhere, there is a longstanding discussion amongst scholars on
               the topic of innovation in construction – but what of
               transformation in construction? Is it different, and if so – how?
               We set out with this Special Issue to answer these questions and
               advance the theoretical understanding of the transformation of
               the built environment, and how this requires the construction
               industry to transform accordingly. We believe that a
               “transforming construction” research agenda entails a
               multi-scalar perspective and therefore called for papers on
               industry-level transforming, firm-level transforming, and
               project- and programme-level transforming. We also recognise the
               process focus in contemporary social science through our framing
               of “transforming” construction as never-ending, and by seeking
               out accounts of how this is unfolding in practice. This resulting
               Special Issue will hopefully act as a provocation for new
               perspectives on transforming construction: it attempts to
               revisit, re-evaluate, and re-invent how we conceptualise both
               construction and construction research. The eight papers build on
               a strong legacy of research on innovation in construction
               management, while providing new insights on what is being
               transformed and how; locating, albeit tentatively, where the
               future debates are; and identifying spaces where rich data may be
               found. Readers will find a stimulating range of conceptual
               thinking and empirical evidence being brought to bear on change,
               innovation, and transformation, with extensive discussion of
               implications for future research on construction policy,
               projects, and people, broadening our field of view and drawing
               out strong new ideas to guide practice. The structure of this
               Editorial is as follows. First, we provide a synthetic recap of
               key themes within the transforming construction topic, as
               outlined in the Call for Papers. Secondly, we summarise the
               content of the eight accepted papers, positioning each paper
               under one of three headings, which reflect the multi-scale
               perspective of the Special Issue and as presented previously in
               the Call for Papers. We then go on to a discussion section, in
               which we set out what we see as five major themes emerging from
               the papers, characterising what transforming construction looks
               like from the perspective of these authors. There is a conclusion
               section to identify what the editorial team feels are the most
               pertinent reflections and questions, in a bid to offer some
               direction to future research in the area, followed by a short
               commentary on some limitations of the Special Issue.",

              one-off products designed specifically for individual projects via
              an engineer-to-order process. However, recently developed flexible
              product platforms based on the theory of mass customisation offer
              product flexibility with affordable costs. The degree of
              commonality between products can also be increased by applying the
              products-in-products concept. This study aims to conceptualise and
              test theories of mass customisation through modularisation for
              applications in the construction industry. Three case studies on
              building and infrastructure construction projects using different
              specification processes (modify-to-order, configure-to-order and
              select-variant) are presented. The results show that the
              products-in-products concept is useful for enabling mass
              customisation in construction. While select-variant specification
              is compatible with relatively integral designs, the architecture
              must have a modular structure to enable modify-to-order or
              configure-to-order customisation.",

  abstract    = "In 1966, the philosopher Michael Polanyi observed, ``We can
                 know more than we can tell... The skill of a driver cannot be
                 replaced by a thorough schooling in the theory of the motorcar;
                 the knowledge I have of my own body differs altogether from the
                 knowledge of its physiology.'' Polanyi's observation largely
                 predates the computer era, but the paradox he identified--that
                 our tacit knowledge of how the world works often exceeds our
                 explicit understanding--foretells much of the history of
                 computerization over the past five decades. This paper offers a
                 conceptual and empirical overview of this evolution. I begin by
                 sketching the historical thinking about machine displacement of
                 human labor, and then consider the contemporary incarnation of
                 this displacement--labor market polarization, meaning the
                 simultaneous growth of high-education, high-wage and
                 low-education, low-wages jobs--a manifestation of Polanyi's
                 paradox. I discuss both the explanatory power of the
                 polarization phenomenon and some key puzzles that confront it.
                 I then reflect on how recent advances in artificial
                 intelligence and robotics should shape our thinking about the
                 likely trajectory of occupational change and employment growth.
                 A key observation of the paper is that journalists and expert
                 commentators overstate the extent of machine substitution for
                 human labor and ignore the strong complementarities. The
                 challenges to substituting machines for workers in tasks
                 requiring adaptability, common sense, and creativity remain
                 immense. Contemporary computer science seeks to overcome
                 Polanyi's paradox by building machines that learn from human
                 examples, thus inferring the rules that we tacitly apply but do
                 not explicitly understand.",
