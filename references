                     e-commerce, or games, have been transferred to the virtual
                     world nowadays. This transition has been addressed many
                     times by science fic- tion literature and cinematographic
                     works, which often show dystopic visions in which humans

  abstract = "Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy While
              the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is trapped on
              two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf between the real and
              digital worlds prevents us from fully exploiting the volumes of
              information now available to us. Augmented reality, a set of
              technologies that superimposes digital data and images on
              physical objects and environments, is closing this gap. By
              putting information directly into the context in which we'll
              apply it, AR increases our ability to absorb and act on it. AR
              will become the new interface between humans and machines, say
              Michael E. Porter of Harvard and James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of
              the industrial software maker PTC. Many people are familiar with
              AR entertainment applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR
              is being applied in far more consequential ways in business.
              Pioneering organizations are already implementing it in product
              development, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, service, and
              training---and are seeing major gains in quality and
              productivity. AR improves how users visualize information,
              receive and follow instructions, and interact with products.
              AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts the heat
              signature of a patient's veins into an image superimposed on the
              skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR to show
              trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing---and has cut the time
              it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory workers
              have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using voice
              commands in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR will
              have a wide impact on how companies compete. This article walks
              readers through the questions firms need to ask when integrating
              it into their strategies and operations. The article also
              includes HBR's first embedded AR experiences, which readers can
              launch by downloading a new HBR app on their mobile devices and
              then pointing them at targeted images in the magazine's pages.

               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal
               dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and
               cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In
               this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and
               diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal
               Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter
               may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the
               former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive
               behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant
               feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the
               application of the approach, we designed and developed several
               key components of an intelligent learning environment for
               teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic
               surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical
               interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard
               validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to
               produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.",

               systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based
               on individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far
               superior to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors
               are `intelligent tutors' because they are able to continously
               adapt the content and style of their instruction to best meet
               the needs of the learner. The historical evolution of
               intelligent tutoring systems is presented. The starting point
               was programmed instruction in the late 1960s, followed by
               knowledge-based tutors that try to simulate good human tutors by
               the integrated use of domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and
               knowledge about the individual student. Finally some important
               current trends like distance learning, collaborative learning,
               and Web-based learning are outlined. The presentation is given
               within a cognitive science point of view. From this perspective

               effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
               effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as well
               as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further
               tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring
               tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to promote a more
               interactive style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style,
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Instead, tutors were encouraged to prompt the students.
               Surprisingly, students learned just as effectively even when
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Their learning in the interactive style of tutoring is
               attributed to construction from deeper and a greater amount of
               scaffolding episodes, as well as their greater effort to take

               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed
               to support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for
               military tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games
               including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these
               game-based desktop tutors have also been limited to adaptive
               instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and
               decision-making). The military requires adaptive instruction to
               extend beyond the desktop to be compatible with the physical
               nature of many tasks performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
               This article examines how commercial sensor technologies might
               be adapted to work with GIFT and support tailored
               computer-guided instruction in the psychomotor domain for a
               military medical training task, specifically hemorrhage control.
               Toward this goal, we evaluated the usability and system features
               of commercial smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies.
               Smart glasses were selected as the focus of this study over
               handheld mobile devices in order to promote a hands-free
               experience during the training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a
               mannequin. Pressure sensors were selected to provide direct
               measures of effectiveness during the application of tourniquets
               and pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses
               and pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
               other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
               adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s point-of-need
               and criteria based on established usability heuristics.
               Instruction in the wild is training provided in an environment

               infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of
               operation). We examined a wide range of features and
               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
               psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no

              the majority of existing buildings is not maintained, refurbished

              resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties
              of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in
              existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research,
              involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM
              implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
              presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic.
              Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet,
              due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
              captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of
              information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects
              and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite
              fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research

              merging digital (virtual) contents into real environments.
              Augmented Reality technology has been applied in many application
              domains outside construction (e.g., medical applications and
              surgeries, military training and warfare, manufacturing assembly

              ever-increasing power of hardware rendering systems and tracking

              benefit construction industry. This paper discusses the

  abstract = "Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
              have typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to
              enhance the process of information extraction from building
              information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
              workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated
              the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This
              research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness
              of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency
              through improving the information retrieval process during
              construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach
              was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a
              mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage
              capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop
              experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual
              information retrieval methods (control group), with information
              retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results
              revealed that the participants using the artefact were
              approximately 50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks,
              and committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
              This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing
              information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick
              Response markers can significantly improve the information
              retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration has the

  abstract = "Abstract Augmented reality (AR), a state-of-the-art technology
              for superimposing information onto the real world, has recently
              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies---localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices---which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and
              intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of
              AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access
              to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful,
              and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101
              research efforts, and outlines the research trends and
              opportunities for applying AR in the fields of AEC/FM.",

              to enhance the construction management educational experience.
              One of these new methods is showing real time videos that
              highlight the various elements of concern in the classroom
              lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality
              technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to
              simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal
              constraints of various construction processes. The
              superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to
              virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This
              enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to
              visualize context and hidden processes otherwise unattainable
              through traditional classroom lectures.
              Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved perception
              of reality is created through the combination of the learners'
              ability to understand the complexity of construction products
              (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by viewing the
              real environment augmented with computer-generated information
              layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom with
              undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom

  abstract = "Abstract Construction is a high hazard industry which involves
              many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety
              has always been advocated by many construction companies, and
              they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
              protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
              Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed
              trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
              applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing
              complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive
              knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the
              state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety
              (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and
              propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review
              and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes,
              products and the related training and evaluation paradigms.
              Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly
              journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting
              of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety
              scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a
              number of technical features and types that could be implemented
              in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and
              further elaborated, while significant application domains and
              trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e.,
              hazards recognition and identification, safety training and
              education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but
              not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the
              in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works.
              It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist
              both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating
              BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or
              her performance using MR. To address these topics, a
              quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of
              eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with
              building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and
              MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires
              to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results
              suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity
              rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to
              fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the
              number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the
              conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally,
              nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most
              still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design
              communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because
              many of the participants had substantial prior experience
              constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed
              the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size
              limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the
              contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a
              proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for
              communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not
              currently observed through the use of a paper-based communication

               excellency in man's character.'' Of this perfection Maimonides
               says: ``Imagine a person being alone, and having no connection
               whatever with any other person; all his good moral principles
               are at rest, they are not required and give man no perfection
               whatever. These principles are only necessary and useful when
               man comes in contact with others.'' ``The fourth kind of
               perfection is the true perfection of man; the possession of the
               highest intellectual faculties . . . .'' In justification of his
               assertion, this extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges:
               ``Examine the first three kinds of perfection; you will find
               that if you possess them, they are not your property, but the
               property of others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is
               exclusively yours; no one else owns any part of it.''",

  abstract = "Purpose This paper aims to compare the performance of building
              trades apprenticeship programs in the USA, sponsored jointly by
              employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
              employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates, including
              participation of women and minorities. The article also looks
              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women
              and ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit
              markedly better performance for all groups on rates of attrition
              and completion. Joint programs have developed various
              innovations, including college credit for training and
              scholarship loans to expand apprenticeship and improve quality
              and retention, although there are no quantitative evaluations of
              the effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
              limitations/implications Statistical information includes about
              65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA. Practical
              implications The paper shows that alternative forms of training
              sponsorship have substantially different effects on enrolment and
              graduation. Identification of the practices, that improve
              enrolment and retention, and their widespread adoption would
              enhance the effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value
              The dataset used in this paper has not yet been used in any
              publications. The findings regarding joint programs are notable,
              in view of the skilled labor shortages facing the construction

                     ludic that emphasize particular qualities and contexts of
                     experience and particular approaches to intervening in
                     interactive experience have become focal. On the other, a
                     variety of approaches to understanding users and user
                     experience, based on narrative, biography, and role-play
                     have been developed and deployed. These developments can
                     be viewed in terms of one of the seminal commitments of
                     HCI, 'to know the user'. Empathy has been used as a
                     defining characteristic of designer-user relationships
                     when design is concerned with user experience. In this
                     article, we use 'empathy' to help position some emerging
                     design and user-experience methodologies in terms of
                     dynamically shifting relationships between designers,
                     users, and artefacts.",

              major capabilities. A set of computer programs was written and

              questions, and anticipated answers entered in advance by the

              facts, concepts, and procedures; it can generate text, questions,

              utilize its information network to answer questions formulated by
              the student, a mixed-initiative dialogue between student and

               HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more
               deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions
               where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly

               component in mass-market production and are seen as 'customers',

               management and citizens from three different municipalities.

               Agency is understood as a multifaceted construct describing the
               idea that human beings make choices, act on these choices, and
               thereby exercise influence on their own lives as well as their
               environment. We argue that the concept is discussed from three
               different perspectives in the literature---transformational,
               dispositional, and relational---that are each related to
               learning and development in work contexts. These perspectives do
               not reflect incompatible positions but rather different aspects
               of the same phenomena. The chapter also offers an avenue of
               insight into empirical studies that employ agency as a central
               concept as well as discussions about concepts that closely
               overlap with ideas of human beings as agents of power and

               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction
               industry. Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic
               mode and interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE
               device with Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the
               research gaps. Finally, an example experiment is provided to
               demonstrate studying hazard identification using eye tracking in
               construction safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from
               the participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan
               path and the 3D heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic
               construction site scenes. This paper provides an approach of
               applying eye tracking to gather more data in virtual environment
               for the future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design
              of an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two
              aspects of this work have subsequently been used for further
              research. Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its
              associated theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that
              it could be implemented in software. This interpretation has
              informed further research about how one can model context and its
              impact on learning, which has produced a design framework that
              has been successfully applied across a range of educational
              settings. Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The
              software has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
              supported explorations into how to scaffold learners'
              metacognition, how to scaffold learners' motivation and the
              implications of a learner's goal orientation upon their use of
              the software. The findings from these studies have informed our
              understanding of learner scaffolding and have produced consistent
              results to demonstrate the importance of providing learners with
              appropriately challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky's

              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,

              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial

              builds on solid foundations in the learning sciences, computer
              science, education, and the social sciences. We define learning
              at scale as the study of the technologies, pedagogies, analyses,
              and theories of learning and teaching that take place with a
              large number of learners and a high ratio of learners to
              facilitators. The scale of these environments often changes the
              very nature of the interaction and learning experiences. We
              identify three types of technologies that support scale in
              education: dedicated content-agnostic platforms, such as MOOCs;
              dedicated tools, such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems; and
              repurposed platforms, such as social networks. We further
              identify five areas that scale affects: learners, research and
              data, adaptation, space and time, and pedagogy. Introducing the
              papers in this special issue on the topic, we discuss the

  abstract = "This article is a review of experiments comparing the
              effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
              tutoring. ``No tutoring'' refers to instruction that teaches the
              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring
              systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or
              substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other
              tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have
              answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the
              granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases.
              In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of
              answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and
              adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0
              respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead,
              it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d
              = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems
              was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.",

               and the cost of virtual reality, multi-user virtual
               environments, and various forms of mixed reality. These new
               media potentially offer extraordinary opportunities for
               enhancing both motivation and learning across a range of subject
               areas, student developmental levels, and educational settings.
               With the development of practical and affordable virtual reality
               and mixed reality, people now have the chance to experience
               immersive learning both in classrooms and informally in homes,
               libraries, and community centers. The book appeals to a broad
               readership including teachers, administrators, scholars, policy
               makers, instructional designers, evaluators and industry
               leaders.",

               student knowledge assessment method. It is widely used in
               intelligent tutoring systems. In the standard BKT model, all
               knowledge and skills are independent of each other. However, in
               the process of student learning, they have a very close
               relation. A student may understand knowledge B better when he
               masters knowledge A. Therefore, this work introduces a new
               student model based on BKT. It takes the relationship between
               knowledge into account. By doing this, the new model proves
               higher prediction accuracy and performs better. Then this paper
               uses the new model to make a cognitive diagnosis according to
               students? test scores. The diagnostic results can help teachers

               across the world over the past decades. A particularly emerging
               topic is the application of AI in e-learning (AIeL) to improve
               the effectiveness of teaching and learning in precision
               education. This study aims to systematically review publication
               patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals,
               countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a
               co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the
               invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal
               directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total
               of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in
               follow-up studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found
               that a majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and
               applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using
               AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning
               contexts. For field researchers, the visualized network diagram
               serves as a map to explore the invisible relationships among the
               core AIeL research, providing a structural understanding of
               AI-supported research in e-learning contexts. A further
               investigation of the follow-up studies behind the highly
               co-cited links revealed the extended research directions from

               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies---with hardware,

               diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply
               enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many
               tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age
               MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee---two thinkers at the
               forefront of their field---reveal the forces driving the
               reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of
               digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in
               the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced
               infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items
               that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching
               change. Professions of all kinds---from lawyers to truck
               drivers---will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to
               transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift:
               fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as
               productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and
               up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the
               best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity.
               These include revamping education so that it prepares people for
               the next economy instead of the last one, designing new
               collaborations that pair brute processing power with human

               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume

               the opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and
               design. It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing

               environmental and political implications of various
               technological trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon

               주제를 제시하였다. Labor shortages are a serious problem for Korea's
               construction industry. The problem is both quantitative and
               qualitative. There is a shortage in supply as due to a decrease
               in the influx of new labor, and existing workers are less
               productive as they age. The problem will only get worse as more
               and more major public projects are being planned. Options for
               increasing the labor supply are somewhat limited, and thus
               efforts need to be made to adopt new technologies that can
               improve the productivity and efficiency of field work and their
               processes. This paper introduces seven innovation technologies
               that have the best potential to increase productivity and thus
               reduce the burden of labor shortage problems. These include 1)
               Substitution by use of robotics and automation, 2) development
               and applications of Innovative materials to reduce on site field
               work, 3) increase in productivity through the implementation of
               Information Technology, 4) improved productivity through the
               application of modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of
               rework and redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating
               labor skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site
               processes.",

  abstract  = "The construction industry is facing an unprecedented, nationwide
               shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the second largest
               employer in the country and according to a Construction Industry
               Institute study 75\% of contractors are experiencing labor
               shortages that are manifesting themselves as cost overruns
               and/or schedule delays. This crisis has been a long time coming
               and our current culture has not helped the problem. Young people
               who don't go to college are seen as ``failures,'' and fewer
               native-born Americans want to work with their hands, outdoors?at
               any wage. In fact a group of high school students surveyed about
               attractive careers listed construction 498th out of 500 possible
               occupations. Not only does construction have an image problem,
               but also the workforce composition of the future is largely
               minority and women, a challenge for an industry that is
               dominantly and traditionally white male. In order to face this
               labor shortage head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill
               ? Change or continue to accept increases in project cost and
               duration. In response to this challenge, several contractors and
               construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
               programs to recruit more individuals to the construction trades,
               including charter schools, community outreach and active
               participation in high school career guidance by apprenticeship
               programs. More construction companies are realizing that
               diversity practices add economic value to their customers. They
               are establishing mentoring programs for minority and women
               contractors and employing consulting firms to assist them in
               acquiring these new cultural competencies. Other firms are
               focusing their efforts on creating a working atmosphere that
               embraces a diverse workforce, complete with worker training on
               how to effectively deal with the changing workplace culture.
               What positive effects are these approaches having on the overall
               problem? Should these individual efforts to improve the image of
               construction and its thrust for diversity be aligned? This paper
               will attempt to highlight the successes that some programs have
               achieved and what new innovations they invoked in their
               endeavors. Additionally, it will address areas where the efforts

  abstract  = "The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest
               challenges facing the construction industry. The Construction
               Users Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their
               workforce availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82
               percent of the respondents reported experiencing work force
               shortages on their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the
               trend had worsened over the previous three years. One promising
               solution to relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to
               provide adequate and effective training. Many research efforts
               on construction worker training have been conducted in the past
               decade in order to address the need and benefits of construction
               craft training. However, a quantitative analysis of construction
               craft trainings benefits and costs from the perspective of
               worker, project and company has rarely been carried out.
               Providing quantifiable analysis regarding the benefits and costs
               of training can help to solve the debate existing in the
               industry regarding the value of craft labor training and improve
               the effectiveness of craft training programs. The research
               investigated existing major datasets relevant with construction
               craft training developed by previous research. Meanwhile, as
               part of this research, a craft director training survey was
               administrated to measure training benefits in productivity,
               turnover, absenteeism safety and rework, as well as information
               such as core training subjects and common barriers for training.
               The primary objective of the study is to qualify the outcomes
               and effectiveness of strategies for construction craft training.
               Four secondary objectives are completed to help achieve the
               primary goal: (I) Identify the major characteristics of
               construction training and major factors affecting construction
               training; (II) Quantitatively measure the outcomes of
               construction training on the individual and project/company
               level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio models based on the
               survey administrated by the study as well as existing industry
               data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity analysis to identify
               real multiskilling patterns among craft workers in order to
               adopt multiskilling training strategies in the construction
               industry.",

               successive Conservative governments have enacted labor

               growth of temporary and part-time workers and the decline of the

               organizing methods and expanded services for members. The fate

               shifts in global economic power, accelerating urbanization, and
               demographic changes have put pressure on the VET to become more
               responsive to the needs of the labour market and society.
               E-learning has been seen as an effective way of improving the
               quality of teaching and learning in VET schools due to its
               various forms. Nevertheless, there has been some disagreement in
               the litearture on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of

  abstract  = "AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced
               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and
               the extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
               system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
               Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
               secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
               that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks
               the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open
               the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet

               activity and to interact with the student based on a deep
               understanding of the students' behavior. This chapter begins by
               providing an overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The
               chapter comments on competing research goals in the field,
               followed by descriptions of two successful systems: (1) the
               Pittsburgh urban math project algebra tutor project and (2) the
               SHERLOCK project. These two systems are being deployed in
               real-world educational environments with substantial success.
               This chapter briefly describes the underlying theory and
               implementation of each system, to motivate later discussions. A
               description of the standard components in an intelligent
               tutoring system is also presented along with a discussion of
               human-computer interaction assessment issues unique to
               educational software. This chapter also provides a prescription

  abstract = "Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves
              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
              high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA).
              To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that
              demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant
              support and was more effective at improving student learning than
              parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve
              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of
              the support.",

              discernible in the ways teachers described seeking out signals

              technology mediated communication made this more difficult in

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the
               level and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In
               this study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters' spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
               develop further solutions that encourage further improvement of
               teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.",

  author    = "Coenen, Johan and Heijke, Hans and Meng, Christoph",
  abstract  = "This paper compares narrow, or specialised, and broad, or less
               specialised, upper-secondary vocational education (VE)
               programmes in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates'
               position in the labour market. The data are from three cohorts
               of the Dutch VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months
               after graduation. The programmes of the highest level---Level
               4---of the school-based learning route are investigated. To
               separate narrow from broad programmes, a novel criterion is
               used, based on the argument that the match between education and
               a job within a narrow programme's occupational domain is better
               than outside that domain and that, for a broad programme, such a
               match does not differ significantly between the programme's
               domain and outside it. This study shows that graduates from
               narrow education programmes have a less favourable labour market
               position than graduates from broad programmes. They have a
               greater chance of being unemployed and are more often mismatched
               in their jobs, both horizontally and vertically. They earn less
               in any case, particularly if their job is outside their
               occupational domain or below their level. They consequently
               experience worse career opportunities and many are more
               dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this problem, it would be
               better to focus on realising a shift in the influx of students
               from narrow to broad education programmes instead of broadening
               all narrow programmes. Besides this shift to broader programmes,
               offering broad variants of narrow programmes while maintaining
               the narrow, specialist variants could be highly allocation
               efficient.",

               policy reforms",
  author    = "Gambin, Lynn and Hogarth, Terence",
  abstract  = "That so many employers in various sectors continue to train
               apprentices despite incurring substantial costs can be taken as
               prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
               investment risk. The main downside in the English apprenticeship
               system is that the overall levels of employer engagement and
               training volumes are considered sub-optimal and in reality there
               is a fine balance which can put the performance of the firm and
               the wider economy at risk due to insufficient skill development.
               This paper draws on data from the Net Costs and Benefits of
               Training to Employers series of studies (carried out between
               1994 and 2012). Each of the original studies consisted of case
               studies of employers in particular sectors in which the costs
               associated with training an apprentice were considered against
               the benefits employers obtain through this activity during the
               training period. Data in the original studies was collected in
               face-to-face interviews with the employers. The data were
               aligned with an accounting framework that captured the relevant
               costs and benefits of apprenticeship training from the
               perspective of the employer. Calculations were carried out to
               also indicate the payback period (i.e. the period after training
               has taken over which an employer could be expected to recoup any
               net cost they had incurred). We present the most comprehensive
               available estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to
               employers in England to illustrate how costs vary across sectors
               and how, for most employers, engaging in apprenticeship training
               leaves them with a net cost at the end of the training period.
               The extent of this net cost at the end of the formal training
               period is found to vary substantially by sector and level of
               apprenticeship and over time, in real terms, the net costs of
               training have tended to increase across all sectors. Employers
               reported a range of rationales for training apprentices; from
               supply-led (e.g. where participation was prompted by training
               providers offering it for free) to more demand-led (e.g. where
               employers saw apprenticeship as necessary for acquiring needed
               skills) reasons. Employer sensitivity to various cost parameters
               depended upon where on the supply- to demand-led continuum they
               fell. Despite various policy changes since the mid-1990s,
               employers' engagement in apprenticeships in England has not
               achieved a significant volume and there are still financial
               risks attached to investing in this form of training. Even with
               the latest reforms of funding and delivery embodied in the move
               to apprenticeship standards and the introduction of an employer
               levy, there is no guarantee that more employers will be willing
               to train apprentices or that those who already engage will train
               more. There is a need to consider various ways of reducing
               employers' risk without inducing unintended behavioural changes
               that counter overall policy objectives.",

               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life.

              lining with a square base area of 80 $\times$ 80 cm and 140 cm in

              studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating

              of construction reveals advanced technical know-how and, till

  author   = "D'Amico, Bernardino and Pomponi, Francesco and Hart, Jim",
  abstract = "The building and construction sector is a large contributor to
              anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the vastest
              amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
              hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
              construction are of fundamental importance for national and
              global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
              mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less
              of the same material) and substitution (using a different
              material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
              focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
              floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
              innovative, does not require any technological development nor
              upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
              immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We
              combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across
              both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for different
              levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction in the next
              30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions saving
              potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence
              interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full
              uptake of the hybrid construction system by 2050. Our analysis
              does not account for carbon sequestration potential in timber,
              which would make the savings much greater. Still, the overall
              savings represent a 1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas
              emissions generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
              non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
              net-zero carbon buildings.",

              Manzone, Julian and Schwartz, Daniel L",
  abstract = "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
              effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
              because their training has not fully prepared them to do so. To
              address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
              systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
              'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
              learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
              information, to use resources effectively and innovatively, and
              to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving in
              practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have developed
              study designs that use dynamic assessments to measure what
              trainees have acquired in the past, as well as what they are able
              to learn in the present. More recently, researchers have also
              started to emphasise and measure whether and how trainees take
              action to gain the information they need to learn. Knowing that
              there are study designs and emerging metrics for assessing PFL,
              the next question is how to design instruction that helps
              trainees develop PFL capacities. Although research evidence is
              still accumulating, the current evidence base suggests training
              that encourages 'productive failure' through guided discovery
              learning (i.e. where trainees solve problems and perform tasks
              without direct instruction, though often with some form of
              feedback) creates challenging conditions that enhance learning
              and equip trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS:
              Preparation for future learning and the associated capacity of
              being adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
              practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
              assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
              explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in the
              health care workplace to inform the design of instruction for
              developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours that
              relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential sociocultural
              barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to learn from their
              daily practice.",

               proposed by teachers as a way to address theoretical concepts in
               a practical context. The difficulties encountered by apprentices
               while creating paper based sketches motivated the development of
               a tabletop warehouse simulation providing apprentices with a
               Tangible User Interface in the form of a small-scale model. We
               compare drawings and tangible representational modalities with
               regards to three phases of design problem solving. Tinkering
               with tangibles is described as an easy way to engage into the
               problem. The physical properties of tangibles facilitate the
               extraction of features relevant for verification. The limited

               been proven to provide intuition to human computer interface
               with richness of a tactile sense. Recent implementations in that
               field, however, have inherited a 2D Graphical User Interface
               (GUI) scheme and work as isolated systems. Consequently, the
               systems are limited in supporting intuitive interfaces and
               various applications. This paper presents an AR-based tangible
               interaction system for table-top interaction environments. A
               projector displays information or graphical images on the table
               through back-projection. Two cameras on and under the table
               track the tangible objects which are attached with ARToolKit
               markers and that are used as interaction tools. Furthermore, a
               Augmentation Display beside the table shows graphical objects
               combined with the real table. The system shares the object
               tracking information of the object as context through the
               vr-UCAM [8]. Moreover, we also present a scheme of tracking
               smoothing based on a tracking prediction using Kalman Filter. As
               an application, the ARTable is integrated with Responsive

  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the
               gamification of virtual assembly planning on the user
               performance, user experience and
               engagement.Design/methodology/approach A multi-touch table was
               used to manipulate virtual parts and gamification features were
               integrated into the virtual assembly environment. An experiment
               was conducted in two conditions: a gamified and a non-gamified
               virtual environment. Subjects had to assemble a virtual pump.
               The user performance was evaluated in terms of the number of
               errors, the feasibility of the generated assembly sequence and
               the user feedback.Findings The gamification reduced the number
               of errors and increased the score representing the number of
               right decisions. The results of the subjective and objective
               analysis showed that the number of errors decreased with
               engagement in the gamified assembly. The increase in the overall
               user experience reduced the number of errors. The subjective
               evaluation showed a significant difference between the gamified
               and the non-gamified assembly in terms of the level of
               engagement, the learning usability and the overall
               experience.Research limitations/implications The effective
               learning retention after training has not been tested, and
               longitudinal studies are necessary. The effect of the used
               gamification elements has been evaluated as a whole; further
               work could isolate the most beneficial features and add other
               elements that might be more beneficial for
               learning.Originality/value The research reported in this paper
               provides valuable insights into the gamification of virtual
               assembly using a low-cost multi-touch interface. The results are
               promising for training operators to assemble a product at the

               Steadily moving beyond a distinction between the physical and

               part of the unfolding of social and cultural practices. Yet, to

               develop within the situated experience of materials, and how
               this situational whole can be supported by design. By
               contributing to both growing materiality scholarship and
               emerging practice-oriented approaches in HCI, this paper
               articulates a framework of materials experience that discusses

               led to the rapid adoption, sharing of 3D models on sites such as
               Thingiverse.com, and visions of a future in which customization
               is a norm and 3D printing can solve a variety of real-world
               problems. However, in practice, creating models is difficult and
               many end users simply print models created by others. In this
               paper, we explore a specific area of model design that is a
               challenge for end users' measurement. When a model must conform
               to a specific real world goal once printed, it is important that
               that goal is precisely specified. We demonstrate that
               measurement errors are a significant (yet often overlooked)
               challenge for end users through a systematic study of the
               sources and types of measurement errors. We argue for a new
               design principle--accommodating measurement error--that
               designers, as well as novice modelers, should to use at design
               time. We offer two strategies--buffer insertion and replacement
               of minimal parts--to help designers, as well as novice modelers,
               to build models that are robust to measurement error. We argue
               that these strategies can reduce the need for and costs of
               iteration and demonstrate their use in a series of printed

               that can be physically opened, closed, pushed, pulled, spun,
               flipped, or swung. But these tangible, interactive reading
               experiences are inaccessible to children with visual
               impairments. This paper presents a set of 3D-printable models
               designed as building blocks for creating movable tactile
               pictures that can be touched, moved, and understood by children
               with visual impairments. Examples of these models are canvases,
               connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders, lifts, walls, and
               cutouts. They can be used to compose movable tactile pictures to
               convey a range of spatial concepts, such as in/out, up/down, and
               high/low. The design and development of these models were
               informed by three formative studies including 1) a survey on
               popular moving mechanisms in children's books and 3D-printed
               parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the process
               creating movable tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego,
               Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based prototypes and an
               informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a
               design language based on XML and CSS for specifying the content
               and structure of a movable tactile picture. Given a
               specification, our system can generate a 3D-printable model. We
               evaluate our approach by 1) transcribing six children's books,
               and 2) conducting six interviews on domain experts including
               four teachers for the visually impaired, one blind adult, two

              essential element within and of education, literacy offers
              possibilities for engaging in everyday life. Health literacy has
              emerged as a means to develop health-promoting practices that has
              meaning in social contexts. Reflecting biomedical interests, the
              focus of health literacy is predominately constructed as a
              neutral and technical process that has specific meaning and
              practice, positioning it as functional literacy. This paper
              presents one approach to critical health literacy based on a
              multidimension (3D) approach with literacy as a situated social
              practice. The 3D model will be described and then the model's
              application to health literacy will be explored. The use of the
              3D model to build critical health literacy challenges the
              biomedical approach to health literacy as solely functional
              literacy. Functional literacy is not sufficient for a person to
              build a critical social consciousness and illuminate how social
              determinates of health create inequitable health or how it could
              be ameliorated. Social justice and equity are presented as
              fundamental prerequisites for health. Working with young people

              and education offers space for possibilities around literacy

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology employed
               in many research studies. Qualitative and quantitative data
               generation techniques can be used in a grounded theory study.
               Grounded theory sets out to discover or construct theory from
               data, systematically obtained and analysed using comparative
               analysis. While grounded theory is inherently flexible, it is a
               complex methodology. Thus, novice researchers strive to
               understand the discourse and the practical application of
               grounded theory concepts and processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of
               this article is to provide a contemporary research framework
               suitable to inform a grounded theory study. RESULT: This article
               provides an overview of grounded theory illustrated through a
               graphic representation of the processes and methods employed in
               conducting research using this methodology. The framework is
               presented as a diagrammatic representation of a research design
               and acts as a visual guide for the novice grounded theory
               researcher. DISCUSSION: As grounded theory is not a linear
               process, the framework illustrates the interplay between the
               essential grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative
               actions involved. Each of the essential methods and processes
               that underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
               CONCLUSION: Rather than an engagement in philosophical
               discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be used
               in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a framework for
               a research study design can be used to guide and inform the
               novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using grounded
               theory. Research findings and recommendations can contribute to
               policy or knowledge development, service provision and can
               reform thinking to initiate change in the substantive area of
               inquiry.",

               detrimental impact on those allocated to the lowest sets. Taking
               a Bourdieusian approach, we propose that setting can be
               understood as a practice through which the social and cultural
               reproduction of dominant power relations is enacted within
               schools. Drawing on survey data from 12,178 Year 7 (age 11/12)
               students and discussion groups and individual interviews with 33
               students, conducted as part of a wider project on secondary
               school grouping practices, we examine the views of students who
               experience setting, exploring the extent to which the legitimacy
               of the practice is accepted or challenged, focusing on students'
               negative views about setting. Analyses show that privileged
               students (White, middle class) were most likely to be in top
               sets whereas working‐class and Black students were more likely
               to be in bottom sets. Students in the lowest sets (and boys,
               Black students and those in receipt of free school meals) were
               the most likely to express negative views of setting and to
               question the legitimacy and `fairness' of setting as a practice,
               whereas top‐set students defended the legitimacy of setting and
               set allocations as `natural' and `deserved'. This paper argues
               that setting is incompatible with social justice approaches to
               education and calls for the foregrounding of the views of those
               who are disadvantaged by the practice as a tool for challenging

               the underlying principles are universal. While this process is
               often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with
               vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging
               to navigate -- a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet,

              hold utility for a broad range of social sciences. They honor a

                 financial challenges faced by the Research Councils and the UK
                 Government has accelerated this shift, creating an urgent need
                 to explore both its potential and hazards for a range of
                 studies. While some progress in carrying out large-scale
                 complex social surveys on the web has been made, there is
                 still no consensus about how this can best be achieved while
                 maintaining population representativeness and preserving data
                 quality. To address this problem, the NCRM funded a network of
                 methodological innovation ``Web Surveys for the General
                 Population: How, Why and When?'' (also known by its acronym
                 GenPopWeb). A key objective of the network's activities was to
                 review and synthesise existing knowledge about the use of
                 web-based data collection for general population samples and

               Searching all papers in the IDC conference proceedings and
               IJCCI, 157 papers were found that use the word stem 'ethic*'.
               Based on our analysis of these papers, our study demonstrates
               that while ethics is frequently mentioned, the literature
               remains underdeveloped in a number of areas including definition
               and theoretical basis, the reporting of formal ethical approval
               procedures, and the extent to which design and participation

  abstract = "Learning Analytics is an emerging research field and design
              discipline which occupies the `middle space' between the learning
              sciences/educational research, and the use of computational
              techniques to capture and analyse data (Suthers and Verbert,
              2013). We propose that the literature examining the triadic
              relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge),
              pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching) and assessment
              provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space.
              We provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the
              understandings of particular analytics are informed by this
              triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might design
              analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order learning,
              we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the
              nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a
              pragmatic, sociocultural perspective are well placed to explore
              this construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples
              provided throughout this paper, through emphasising the

               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant
               and pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in
               frustration and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can
               cause bad VR execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack
               of understanding human perception, interaction, design
               principles, and real users. This book focuses on the human
               elements of VR, such as how users perceive and intuitively
               interact with various forms of reality, causes of VR sickness,
               creating useful and pleasing content, and how to design and
               iterate upon effective VR applications. This book is not just
               for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists,
               psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user
               experience professionals. It is for the entire VR team, as
               everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of
               the many aspects of VR design. The industry is rapidly evolving,

               gathering feedback, and using adjustable processes to

              realistic graphics and interactions that students can hardly
              experience in everyday life. However, the integration of
              immersive VR simulations in science classrooms introduces new
              challenges, whilst there is a lack of learning designs to inform
              practice. As part of this study, we firstly present a learning
              experience (LX) design seeking to introduce an immersive VR
              simulation in Physics classrooms to support high-school students'
              understanding of the Special Theory of Relativity. Then, we
              present an empirical investigation on the enactment and
              evaluation of the proposed LX design, with 109 high-school
              students (10--11th graders). A mixed-method approach was adopted
              to evaluate students' conceptual learning gains along with their
              perceptions of the learning experience, encompassing the
              immersive VR simulation and the inquiry-based learning process

  abstract  = "Aim/Purpose: This paper presents an exploratory case study into
               using 360° videos to present small segments of lecture content
               for IT students in an Australian University. The aim of this
               study was to understand; what is the impact of incorporating
               360° videos into class content for students and teaching staff?
               In this study the 360° videos are described as ``learning
               atoms''. Learning atoms are short duration videos (1 to 5
               minutes) captured in 360°. Background: Within this paper we
               conducted experiments in the classroom using 360° videos to
               determine if they have an impact on student's feeling of
               presence with class content. Additionally, to follow up, how
               does the inclusion of 360° impact on the teaching experience.
               Methodology: The methodology used in this study focused on both
               quantitative and qualita-tive aspects. Data was captured at the
               same time during the teaching period to address the research
               questions. In order to gauge the feeling of presence within the
               classroom a short survey was administered to students in the
               undergraduate IT class at the start (pre) and end (post) of the
               semester using the same questions to measure any change.
               Contribution: The main contributions from this study were that
               we demonstrated there is a potential for providing an
               alternative `immersive' content presentation for students. This
               alternative content took the form of 360° learning atoms,
               whereas further showed our nuance process for creating and
               publishing of these atoms. Findings: The results show that for
               students, learning atoms can help improve the sense of presence,
               particularly for remote students, however the interactive
               experience can take student's attention away from the lecturer.
               The results present potential for providing an alternative
               `immersive' content presentation for students, however problems
               for uptake are present for both students and teachers, such as
               image capture quality and file size Impact on Society: We
               foresee this approach as being a new approach to teaching
               students in higher education within online spaces to increase
               engagement and move towards having a richer virtual experience
               no matter the location. Future Research: Future research will be
               conducted to resolve whether presence and engagement is
               supported by the inclusion of 360° videos in the classroom.",

              monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings
              and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour
              intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data

  abstract = "In a construction project, cranes are usually involved in the
              mobilization of materials and equipment. Therefore, a
              well-planned crane movement on a construction job site increases
              the efficiency of construction operations. This is especially the
              case when a crane is being operated from the material storage
              place to the workspace in a highway construction project, because
              the time allowed for such movement is typically tight, as
              constrained by the vehicular traffic on the highway. To explore
              the use of construction simulation in facilitating people?s
              understanding of construction processes, this paper presents a
              crane movement simulation from the site storage location to the
              beam erection location in a highway construction project on the
              Interstate 94. This simulation was modeled in the Unity 3D game
              engine and visualized in a CAVE virtual reality environment. CAVE
              is an immersive virtual reality environment where projections
              according to different view angles of a scene are projected onto
              different walls of a space. The purpose of this simulation is to
              help people plan crane routes during the construction planning
              phase. The objectives of planning the crane routes are minimizing
              crane trip length and trip time so as to minimize interruptions
              to the highway traffic, save construction costs, and achieve more
              sustainable construction operations. The simulation was tried by
              72 volunteers. A survey of these volunteers showed that 95\% of
              them understood crane operations after trying the simulation,
              compared to 35\% before trying the simulation, and 80\% of the

               In this paper, we test the efficacy of natural language tutoring
               to teach and scaffold acquisition of these skills. We describe
               ProPL (Pro-PELL), a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system

               in natural language. The system uses a variety of tutoring
               tactics that leverage students' intuitive understandings of the
               problem, how it might be solved, and the underlying concepts of
               programming. We report the results of a small-scale evaluation

  abstract  = "Purpose Apprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
               published research on apprenticeship training that is
               specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
               the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approach A systematic review
               approach was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using
               SCOPUS databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified
               and analysed.Findings It was found that monitoring and control
               is the most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth
               of studies that has focused on apprentices training in
               developing countries.Research limitations/implications The gaps
               identified in the current knowledge on apprenticeship training
               would serve as a justification for future investigations.
               However, the scope of the review is limited to papers published
               in academic journals and citable through SCOPUS.Practical
               implications The outcomes of the study provide researchers and
               other relevant stakeholders with a concise report on the
               findings of previous studies. It also provides insight into
               strategies for improving the completion rates of apprenticeship
               training in the construction sector.Originality/value A
               systematic evaluation of the extant literature draws on
               theoretical evidence and highlights the factors that are more
               likely to influence the outcomes of apprentice training for

               number of fields which have made impact on education. Critical

               expectation of AIED and its potential impact on education. The
               aim of this study was to analyse and discuss AIED from the
               teacher perspective. This study was carried out as a
               SWOT-analysis, with data gathered from a literature study. Main
               keywords in the literature search were: artificial intelligence,
               artificial intelligence in education, AIED, teacher perspective,
               education and teacher. Themes and patterns in the four main
               categories where further processed as a deductive-inductive
               thematic analysis. Findings indicates that there are both
               promises and threats for the teacher in the contemporary AIED.
               In several aspects the field seems to be in a state of hype but
               as other hype areas there is a potential for maturing and with

  abstract = "It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
              nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread method
              of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship was the
              most common means of learning, used to transmit the knowledge
              required for expert practice in fields from painting and
              sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
              important skills, such as those required for language use and
              social interaction, are learned informally through
              apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
              teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive approximation
              while carrying out a variety of tasks and activities. The
              differences between formal schooling and apprenticeship methods
              are many, but for our purposes, one is most important. Perhaps as
              a by-product of the specialization of learning in schools, skills
              and knowledge taught in schools have become abstracted from their
              uses in the world. In apprenticeship learning, on the other hand,
              target skills are not only continually in use by skilled
              practitioners, but are instrumental to the accomplishment of
              meaningful tasks. Said differently, apprenticeship embeds the
              learning of skills and knowledge in the social and functional
              context of their use. This difference is not academic, but has
              serious implications for the nature of the knowledge that
              students acquire. This paper attempts to elucidate some of those
              implications through a proposal for the retooling of
              apprenticeship methods for the teaching and learning of cognitive
              skills. Specifically, we propose the development of a new
              cognitive apprenticeship to teach students the thinking and
              problem-solving skills involved in school subjects such as
              reading, writing, and mathematics. The organization of the paper
              is as follows: In the first section, we discuss briefly what we
              believe to be key shortcomings in current curricular and
              pedagogical practices. We then present some of the structural
              features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss, in general,
              what would be required to adapt these characteristics to the
              teaching and learning of cognitive skills. In the second section
              we consider in detail three recently developed pedagogical
              ``success models,'' which we believe exemplify aspects of
              apprenticeship methods in teaching the thinking and reasoning
              skills involved in reading, writing and mathematics. We attempt
              to show how and why these methods are successful with regard to
              the development of not only the cognitive, but also the
              metacognitive, skills requited for true expertise. In the final
              section, we organize our ideas on the purposes and
              characteristics of successful teaching into a general framework
              for the design of learning environments, where ``environment''
              includes the content being taught, the pedagogical methods
              employed, the sequencing of learning activities, and the
              sociology of learning. This framework emphasizes how cognitive
              apprenticeship goes beyond the techniques of traditional
              apprenticeship. We hope it will be useful to the field in
              designing, evaluating, and doing research on pedagogical methods,
              materials, and technologies.",

               educators use an instrumental problem-solving approach. The

  author    = "Reiter, Bernd",
  abstract  = "This article seeks to propose a rationale for exploratory
               research in the social sciences. Inspired by the recent debates
               around qualitative methods (Gerring, 2001; George and Bennett,
               2005; Brady and Collier, 2004; Mahoney and Rueschemeyer, 2003;
               Ragin, 2008; to name just a few), I seek to demonstrate that
               exploratory research also has a rightful place within the social
               sciences. In order to live up to its potential, exploratory
               research needs to be conducted in a transparent, honest, and
               selfreflexive way -- and follow a set of guidelines that ensure
               its reliability. Exploratory research, if conducted in such a
               way, can achieve great validity and it can provide new and
               innovative ways to analyze reality. In most cases, exploration
               demands more from the researcher than confirmatory research,
               both in terms of preparation, as well as in terms of willingness
               and ability to expose oneself to foreign cultures and languages
               as well as the courage to engage in a critical and honest
               selfreflection and critique. It also requires intellectual
               engagement with the topic at stake far beyond the needs of those
               running regressions from their office computers. However,
               exploratory research normally demands less money to conduct, as
               most projects can be done by one researcher alone, without the
               need to mobilize, train, and pay, large research apparatuses.
               Given the disciplinary power of elite scholars and academic
               institutions when it comes to selecting research through funding
               and hiring, exploratory research thus has great emancipatory
               potential, because it can escape the disciplinary power of
               senior ``peers'' and mainstream funding agencies. To legitimize
               and provide a solid epistemological ground for exploratory
               research in the social sciences, it needs to be grounded in a
               philosophy of science; it has to be articulated within an
               epistemological framework; and it has to formulate a
               comprehensive methodological framework that justifies its
               methods. Thought also needs to be given to the ontology of the
               social sciences, as decisions about what counts as real and what
               we shall accept as a fact necessarily impact our strategy of
               inquiry.",

               has the goal to cover a broad range of topics in the VET field
               from all relevant scientific disciplines. The journal has
               therefore an international pluridisciplinary editorial board and
               also an advisory board with leading international academics in
               the fields of pedagogy, psychology, sociology and economics. The

               in the field of VET. In addition the empirical orientation of
               the journal should make it and interesting source of information

              have emerged as key concepts in safety management which promise a
              move away from bureaucracy and a means to manage safety without
              sacrificing performance. However, attempts to apply these ideas
              outside the ultra-safe sectors within which they developed have
              so far been limited. This paper uses the construction industry as
              a test case to explore the applicability of HRO and RE in a less
              highly regulated context. Through this discussion the research
              gaps are highlighted which have prevented the expansion of these
              new approaches into new sectors. The project-based nature,
              transient workforce, widespread outsourcing of labour and
              financial pressure of the construction sector limit opportunities
              for investment in employees and learning from experience; hence,
              developing principles advocated by HRO and RE such as management
              commitment, sensitivity to the frontline, prioritisation of
              safety, empowerment of employees, and a just culture presents a
              significant challenge. In spite of these barriers, there are also
              opportunities to be considered for construction to incorporate
              aspects of HRO and RE at an employee-centred level rather than
              organisational: Aspects of mindfulness and imagination; RE's
              progressive understanding of accidents; and its holistic approach
              to cultivating resilience. It is argued that these opportunities
              offer a useful perspective for reframing safety debates in
              construction. The paper concludes with a research agenda which
              puts forward the need to extend and adapt aspects of HRO and RE
              in order to tackle some of the key characteristics of
              construction, namely subcontractor networks and temporary

              circumscribed receptive fields, whereas rate codes involve
              open-ended response patterns that peak in the periphery. This
              coding format discrepancy therefore poses a potential problem for
              brain regions responsible for representing both visual and
              auditory information. Here, we investigated the coding of
              auditory space in the primate superior colliculus(SC), a
              structure known to contain visual and oculomotor maps for guiding
              saccades. We report that, for visual stimuli, neurons showed
              circumscribed receptive fields consistent with a map, but for
              auditory stimuli, they had open-ended response patterns
              consistent with a rate or level-of-activity code for location.
              The discrepant response patterns were not segregated into
              different neural populations but occurred in the same neurons. We
              show that a read-out algorithm in which the site and level of SC
              activity both contribute to the computation of stimulus location
              is successful at evaluating the discrepant visual and auditory
              codes, and can account for subtle but systematic differences in
              the accuracy of auditory compared to visual saccades. This
              suggests that a given population of neurons can use different
              codes to support appropriate multimodal behavior.",

               A virtual (three-dimensional) audio display aims to allow the
               user to perceive the position of a sound source at an arbitrary
               position in three-dimensional space despite the fact that the
               generated sound may be emanating from a fixed number of
               loudspeakers at fixed positions in space or a pair of
               headphones. The foundation of virtual audio rests on the
               development of technology to present auditory signals to the
               listener's ears so that these signals are perceptually
               equivalent to those the listener would receive in the

  abstract  = "Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant
               physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual
               interpretations (``percepts'') that alternate over time.
               Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive,
               suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies
               changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to
               address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we
               introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil
               dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a
               continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a
               gradual subjective report. We find that the ``reflexes'' reflect
               the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both reflexes
               show a gradual dependence on the time relative to perceptual
               transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick deflections, which
               are highly correlated with the reflex measures, indicate gradual
               transitions. Physically simulating wave-like transitions between
               percepts suggest piece-meal rivalry (i.e., different regions of
               space belonging to distinct percepts) as one possible
               explanation for the gradual transitions. Furthermore, the
               reflexes show that dominance durations depend on whether or not
               the percept is actively reported. In addition, reflexes respond
               to transitions with shorter latencies than the subjective report
               and show an abundance of short dominance durations. This failure
               to report fast changes in dominance may result from limited
               access of introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes
               reveal that rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is
               modulated by the required action (response mode), and that rapid
               transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from
               awareness.",

               and visual messages to promote eco-sustainable driving behavior.
               The driving simulator was implemented through the Unity game
               engine; a large street environment, including high-speed and
               urban sections, was created to examine different driving
               behaviors. The hardware setup included a gaming driving seat,
               equipped with a steering wheel and pedals; the virtual scenarios
               were displayed through an Oculus Rift headset to guarantee an
               immersive experience. Haptic stimulation (i.e., vibrations) was
               delivered to the driver through the accelerator pedal, while
               visual stimuli (i.e., icons and colors) were shown on a virtual
               head-up display. The sensory feedbacks were presented both alone
               and in combination, providing information about excessive
               acceleration and speed. Four different virtual scenarios, each
               one including a distracting element (i.e., navigator, rain,
               call, and traffic), were also created. Ten participants tested
               the simulator. Fuel consumption was evaluated by calculating a
               mean power index (MPI) in reference to the sensory feedback
               presentation; physiological reactions and responses to a
               usability survey were also collected. The results revealed that
               the haptic and visuo-haptic feedback were responsible for an MPI
               reduction, respectively, for 14\% and 11\% compared with a
               condition of no feedback presentation; while visual feedback
               alone resulted in an MPI increase of 11\%. The efficacy of
               haptic feedback was also accompanied by a more relaxing
               physiological state of the users, compared with the visual
               stimulation. The system's usability was adequate, although
               haptic stimuli were rated slightly more intrusive than the
               visual ones. Overall, these preliminary results highlight how
               promising the use of the haptic channel can be in communicating

              increased acceptance throughout cognitive science, shifting from
              relatively minor status to increasing importance. Nevertheless,
              researchers wonder whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart
              of the cognitive system or are peripheral to classic symbolic
              mechanisms. Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by
              demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed
              theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory driven
              over the next 30 years. Another likely development is the
              increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into cognitive
              architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive phenomena.
              As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of these
              architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along with many
              original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded cognition are
              likely to be heavily influenced by both cognitive neuroscience
              and social neuroscience, and also by developmental science and
              robotics. Aspects from the three major perspectives in cognitive
              science-classic symbolic architectures, statistical/dynamical
              systems, and grounded cognition-will probably be integrated
              increasingly in future theories, each capturing indispensable
              aspects of intelligence.",

  author    = "Saunders, Mirko and Quaiser-Pohl, Claudia M",
  abstract  = "Many studies deal with solution strategies in mental-rotation
               tests. The approaches range from global analysis, attention to
               object parts, holistic and piecemeal strategy to a combined
               strategy. Other studies do not speak of strategies, but of
               holistic or piecemeal processes or even of holistic or piecemeal
               rotation. The methodological approach used here is to identify
               mental-rotation strategies via gaze patterns derived from
               eye-tracking data when solving chronometric mental-rotation
               tasks with gender-stereotyped objects. The mental-rotation test
               consists of 3 male-stereotyped objects (locomotive, hammer,
               wrench) and 3 femalestereotyped objects (pram, hand mirror,
               brush) rotated at eight different angles. The sample consisted
               of 16 women and 10 men (age: M=21.58; SD=4.21). The results of a
               qualitative analysis with two individual objects (wrench and
               brush) showed four different gaze patterns. These gaze patterns
               appeared with different frequency in the two objects and
               correlated differently with performance and response time. The
               results indicate either an objectoriented or an egocentric
               mental-rotation strategy behind the gaze patterns. In general, a
               new methodological approach has been developed to identify
