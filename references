                 organisations either believe they have such practices in place
                 or at least understand they are relevant to the knowledge work
                 commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from
                 the literature, however, is a solid foundation for the
                 philosophies underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit
                 knowledge informs the KM space. Research over decades shows
                 tacit knowledge underpins all other forms of knowledge,
                 enabling the interpretation and judicious application of
                 knowledge, leading (at its highest levels) to the concept of
                 wisdom. As an academic discipline, artificial intelligence
                 (AI) was established before KM, has been grounded in the
                 computing discipline for many decades, and is applied broadly
                 in many domains. This paper explores how AI can inform the KM
                 debate. Rather than simply provide examples of AI success
                 stories as applied to KM in practice, it explores the
                 theoretical and practical limitations of AI and KM in unison,
                 providing at the same time a strong epistemological
                 understanding of both disciplines as a means of furthering the

              projects do not readily add tangible intrinsic value to the
              end-users. In large-scale construction projects, the process of
              monitoring the implementation of every single part of buildings
              and reflecting them on the BIM models can become highly labour
              intensive and error-prone, due to the vast amount of data
              produced in the form of schedules, reports and photo logs. In
              order to address the mentioned methodological and technical gap,
              this paper presents a framework and a proof of concept prototype
              for on-demand automated simulation of construction projects,
              integrating some cutting edge IT solutions, namely image
              processing, machine learning, BIM and Virtual Reality. This study
              utilised the Unity game engine to integrate data from the
              original BIM models and the as-built images, which were processed
              via various computer vision techniques. These methods include
              object recognition and semantic segmentation for identifying
              different structural elements through supervised training in
              order to superimpose the real world images on the as-planned
              model. The proposed framework leads to an automated update of the
              3D virtual environment with states of the construction site. This
              framework empowers project managers and stockholders with an
              advanced decision-making tool, highlighting the inconsistencies

               this to ``gameplay'', the techniques used by game designers to
               keep players engaged. The author suggests several ways to bring
               the motivation of gameplay into education, and predicts that

              project, and no contractor would be able to operate without the
              skilled laborers that they employ. The construction industry has
              been subject to a shortage of skilled labor for the last two
              decades for many reasons, including the poor image of
              construction workers among the public, inadequate training
              measures, and an aging workforce. Reviewing the literature on the
              matter shows that the leading cause of shortage is low pay and
              increasing age of the workforce overall, while the demand for
              labor grows at a faster rate than the supply of labor grows. Poor
              worker retention practices were also identified as a cause for
              shortage and a reason for workers leaving the industry, and
              proper retention tactics are assessed, including monetary and
              non-monetary considerations for workers in order to foster a
              better employer-employee relationship. Recruiting practices among

  title     = "Offsite {HUB} (Scotland): establishing a collaborative regional
               framework for knowledge exchange in the {UK}",
  author    = "Hairstans, Robert and Smith, Ryan E",
  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThe UK is set to become Europe?s largest construction
               market by 2030. However, UK construction productivity
               performance is regarded as weak, with low skills levels
               considered to be a key contributory factor. Consequently,
               off-site construction has been identified by the UK Government
               as a vehicle for improving productivity levels if the skills
               deficiencies in this particular market segment can be addressed.
               A series of projects were, therefore, launched by the UK
               Commission for Employment and Skills (UKCES) to encourage an
               R\&D approach to skills and development application in the
               workplace. This paper reports on one of these research projects,
               a University and Industry collaboration between two of the
               largest off-site timber platform frame manufacturers in the UK.
               The paper explains how a needs analysis process was utilised to
               develop skills training content tailored to the immediate needs
               of the industry partners. It also explores how working with
               academia and a wider community of stakeholders allowed this
               training content to result in sector-level impact via knowledge
               exchange activities and generic skills material creation.
               Finally, the novel approach of utilising ?Hoshin? planning to
               form a larger regional Offsite HUB (Scotland) Community of
               Practice, with a developed plan for collaboration aligned with
               international off-site research objectives, is also explained.
               The case study presented in this paper is evidence of success in
               mobilising industry through creating communities of practice to
               advance the construction sector regionally. It also provides a
               generalisable method that is reproducible by other
               university?industry cohorts in order to realise shared

                   textured 3D meshes from a given text prompt as input. To
                   this end, we leverage pre-trained 2D text-to-image models to
                   synthesize a sequence of images from different poses. In
                   order to lift these outputs into a consistent 3D scene
                   representation, we combine monocular depth estimation with a
                   text-conditioned inpainting model. The core idea of our
                   approach is a tailored viewpoint selection such that the
                   content of each image can be fused into a seamless, textured
                   3D mesh. More specifically, we propose a continuous
                   alignment strategy that iteratively fuses scene frames with
                   the existing geometry to create a seamless mesh. Unlike
                   existing works that focus on generating single objects or
                   zoom-out trajectories from text, our method generates
                   complete 3D scenes with multiple objects and explicit 3D
                   geometry. We evaluate our approach using qualitative and

              paper focused on the variant characteristics of ITSs developed
              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,
              Google scholar, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases.
              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial
              intelligent techniques applied in the ITSs. These techniques
              enable ITSs to deliver adaptive guidance and instruction,
              evaluate learners, define and update the learner's model, and
              classify or cluster learners. Specifically, the performance of
              the system, learner's performance, and experiences were used for
              evaluation of ITSs. Most ITSs were designed for web user
              interfaces. Although these systems could facilitate reasoning in
              the learning process, these systems have rarely been applied in
              experimental courses including problem-solving, decision-making
              in physics, chemistry, and clinical fields. Due to the important
              role of a cell phone in facilitating personalized learning and
              given the low rate of using mobile-based ITSs, this study has

  abstract  = "Open Building Manufacturing (ManuBuild) aims to promote the
               European construction industry beyond the state of the art.
               However, this requires the different stakeholders to be well
               informed of what `Open Building Manufacturing' actually entails
               with respect to understanding the underlying concepts, benefits
               and risks. This is further challenged by the `traditional ways
               of learning' which have been predominantly criticised for being
               entrenched in theories with little or no emphasis on practical
               issues. Experiential learning has long been suggested to
               overcome the problems associated with the traditional ways of
               learning. In this respect, it has the dual benefit of appealing
               to adult learner's experience base, as well as increasing the
               likelihood of performance change through training.
               On-the-job-training (OJT) is usually sought to enable
               `experiential' learning; and it is argued to be particularly
               effective in complex tasks, where a great deal of independence
               is granted to the task performer. However, OJT has been
               criticised for being expensive, limited, and devoid of the
               actual training context. Consequently, in order to address the
               problems encountered with OJT, virtual reality (VR) solutions
               have been proposed to provide a risk free environment for
               learning without the `do-or-die' consequences often faced on
               real construction projects. Since ManuBuild aims to promote the
               EU construction industry beyond the state of the art; training
               and education therefore needs also to go beyond the state of the
               art in order to meet future industry needs and expectations.
               Hence, a VR interactive learning environment was suggested for
               Open Building Manufacturing training to allow experiential
               learning to take place in a risk free environment, and
               consequently overcome the problems associated with OJT. This
               chapter discusses the development, testing, and validation of
               this prototype.",

               for research of the theoretical work which acknowledges a debt
               to the writings of L.S. Vygotsky and sociologists whose work
               echoes his sociogenetic commitments, particularly Basil
               Bernstein. It provides a variety of views on the ways in which
               these two, conceptually linked, bodies of work can be brought
               together in theoretical frameworks which give new possibilities
               for empirical work. This book has two aims. First, to expand and
               enrich the Vygotskian theoretical framework; second, to
               illustrate the utility of such enhanced sociological
               imaginations and how they may be of value in researching
               learning in institutions and classrooms. It includes
               contributions from long-established writers in education,
               psychology and sociology, as well as relatively recent
               contributors to the theoretical debates and the body of research
               to which it has given rise, presenting their own arguments and
               justifications for forging links between particular theoretical
               traditions and, in some cases, applying new insights to obdurate
               empirical questions. Chapters include: Curriculum and pedagogy
               in the sociology of education; some lessons from comparing
               Durkheim and Vygotsky Dialectics, politics and contemporary
               cultural-historical research, exemplified through Marx and

              now a design science. Like other design professionalsaOCo
              architects, engineers, programmers OCo teachers have to work out
              creative and evidence-based ways of improving what they do. Yet
              teaching is not treated as a design profession. Every day,
              teachers design and test new ways of teaching, using learning
              technology to help their students. Sadly, their discoveries often
              remain local. By representing and communicating their best ideas
              as structured pedagogical patterns, teachers could develop this
              vital professional knowledge collectively. Teacher professional

               engineering and manufacturing processes have led to a
               significant expansion in the use of pre-assembled components,
               which are fitted to finished structures on site. Collectively,
               such processes are becoming known as ``offsite construction.'' A
               ground-breaking text, Offsite Architecture establishes the
               current -- and future -- state of thinking in this field. A
               range of the most highly regarded thinkers and practitioners
               from around the globe share their ideas and practical findings
               on offsite prefabrication, examining theory and practice,
               opportunities and challenges, successes and failures. A timely
               response to the growing interest in this method, the book
               provides the fundamental basis for a critical, reflective
               approach to offsite architecture. Contributions from both
               academics and professionals make Offsite Architecture required
               reading for practitioners as well as students taking courses in
               architecture, prefabrication, construction and engineering.",

               Gallagher, Tony and Ludvigsen, Sten R",
  abstract  = "This ground-breaking book brings together cutting-edge
               researchers who study the transformation of practice through the
               enhancement and transformation of expertise. This is an
               important moment for such a contribution because expertise is in
               transition - moving toward collaboration in inter-organizational
               fields and continuous shaping of transformations. To understand
               and master this transition, powerful new conceptual tools are
               needed and are provided here. The theoretical framework which
               has shaped these studies is Cultural Historical Activity Theory
               (CHAT). CHAT analyses how people and organisations learn to do
               something new, and how both individuals and organisations
               change. The theoretical and methodological tools used have their
               origins in the work of Lev Vygotsky and A.N. Leont'ev. In recent
               years this body of work has aroused significant interest across
               the social sciences, management and communication studies.
               Working as part of an integrated international team, the authors
               identify specific findings which are of direct interest to the
               academic community, such as: the analysis of vertical learning
               between operational and strategic levels within complex
               organizations; the refinement of notions of identity and subject
               position within CHAT; the introduction of the concept of `labour
               power' into CHAT; the development of a method of analysing
               discourse which theoretically coheres with CHAT and the design
               of projects. Activity Theory in Practice will be highly useful
               to practitioners, researchers, students and policy-makers who
               are interested in conceptual and empirical issues in all aspects
               of `activity-based' research.",

               housing and building industries, this book provides a timely
               overview of prefabricated and modular housing. The idea of
               prefabricated and modular housing is not a new one: since the
               19th century, designers, inventors, engineers, builders,
               developers, and entrepreneurs have all been fascinated by the
               idea of the factory-built home. But the current international
               housing shortages and affordability crises have given a new
               urgency to the need to transform building construction in the
               21st century. Richly illustrated and drawing on historical
               examples and contemporary design studies, the book takes the
               reader through the history, theory and design of the prefab,
               leading up to a discussion of contemporary problems and
               opportunities. Including a broad international survey, drawing

               case studies of leading designers and companies, this book
               suggests a future scenario for industrialized building that will

               training-schedule design for efficient utilization of these
               systems are not well established. The present research compared
               performance of two groups, one adopting a mixed practice

               employing a blocked practice schedule (presumably with lower

               significant difference was found with regard to achieved skill
               level and skill consistency. A possible reason is that the
               complexity of the training task created a degree of intra-task
               interference in the blocked practice schedule comparable to the
               interference created by the mixed practice schedule. This result

  title    = "Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy",
  author   = "Porter, Michael E and Heppelmann, James E",
  abstract = "Why Every Organization Needs an Augmented Reality Strategy While
              the physical world is three-dimensional, most data is trapped on
              two-dimensional pages and screens. This gulf between the real and
              digital worlds prevents us from fully exploiting the volumes of
              information now available to us. Augmented reality, a set of
              technologies that superimposes digital data and images on
              physical objects and environments, is closing this gap. By
              putting information directly into the context in which we'll
              apply it, AR increases our ability to absorb and act on it. AR
              will become the new interface between humans and machines, say
              Michael E. Porter of Harvard and James E. Heppelmann, the CEO of
              the industrial software maker PTC. Many people are familiar with
              AR entertainment applications, such as Snapchat filters, but AR
              is being applied in far more consequential ways in business.
              Pioneering organizations are already implementing it in product
              development, manufacturing, logistics, marketing, service, and
              training---and are seeing major gains in quality and
              productivity. AR improves how users visualize information,
              receive and follow instructions, and interact with products.
              AccuVein, for instance, uses AR technology that converts the heat
              signature of a patient's veins into an image superimposed on the
              skin, making them much easier to locate. Boeing uses AR to show
              trainees how to assemble an aircraft wing---and has cut the time
              it takes them to do that task by 35\%. At GE, factory workers
              have achieved a similar gain in efficiency by using voice
              commands in AR experiences to perform complex wiring. AR will
              have a wide impact on how companies compete. This article walks
              readers through the questions firms need to ask when integrating
              it into their strategies and operations. The article also
              includes HBR's first embedded AR experiences, which readers can
              launch by downloading a new HBR app on their mobile devices and
              then pointing them at targeted images in the magazine's pages.

               and execution of a construction project. Current planning
               practices adopted by the construction industry continue to be
               substantially manual. Project information is primarily exchanged
               via paper documents, and the visualization of the facility is
               marginally communicated using 2D drawings. Functions are
               generally planned independently of one another. Previous
               research efforts developed systems that are characterized as
               responsive decision systems, relying mainly on programmed
               knowledge and heuristics for decision-making; reducing or
               eliminating the role of the human planner. This paper presents a
               framework for a new planning approach that will utilize virtual
               reality (VR) modeling techniques coupled with object-oriented
               technologies to develop an integrated virtual planning tool
               called the Virtual Construction Environment (VCE). The proposed
               VCE will enable the project team to undertake inexpensive

  abstract  = "An adaptive guidance system that supports equipment operators
               requires a comprehensive model of task and user behavior that
               considers different skill and knowledge levels as well as
               diverse situations. In this study, we investigated the
               relationships between user behaviors and skill levels under
               operational conditions. We captured sixty samples of two sewing
               tasks performed by five operators using a head-mounted RGB-d
               camera and a static gaze tracker. We examined the operators'
               gaze and head movements, and hand interactions to essential
               regions (hotspots) to determine behavioral differences among
               continuous skill improving experiences. The experimental results
               indicate that some features, such as task execution time and
               user head movements, are good indexes for skill level and
               provide valuable information that can be applied to obtain an
               effective task model. Operators with varying knowledge and
               operating habits demonstrate different operational features,
               which can contribute to the design of user-specific guidance.",

              or deconstructed with BIM yet. Promising benefits of efficient
              resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties
              of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in
              existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research,
              involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM
              implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
              presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic.
              Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet,
              due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
              captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of
              information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects
              and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite
              fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research
              opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to
              existing buildings' requirements.",

  abstract = "Abstract Augmented reality (AR), a state-of-the-art technology
              for superimposing information onto the real world, has recently
              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies---localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices---which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and
              intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of
              AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access
              to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful,
              and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101
              research efforts, and outlines the research trends and
              opportunities for applying AR in the fields of AEC/FM.",

  abstract = "Abstract Construction is a high hazard industry which involves
              many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety
              has always been advocated by many construction companies, and
              they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
              protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
              Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed
              trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
              applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing
              complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive
              knowledge and undergoing training. To better understand the
              state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety
              (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and
              propose possible improvements, this paper starts with a review
              and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes,
              products and the related training and evaluation paradigms.
              Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly
              journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting
              of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety
              scenarios and evaluation methods. According to this taxonomy, a
              number of technical features and types that could be implemented
              in the context of construction safety enhancement are derived and
              further elaborated, while significant application domains and
              trends regarding the VR/AR-CS research are generalized, i.e.,
              hazards recognition and identification, safety training and
              education, safety instruction and inspection, and so on. Last but
              not least, this study sets forth a list of gaps derived from the
              in-depth review and comes up with the prospective research works.
              It is envisioned that the outcomes of this paper could assist
              both researchers and industrial practitioners with appreciating
              the research and practice frontier of VR/AR-CS and soliciting the

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating
              BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or
              her performance using MR. To address these topics, a
              quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of
              eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with
              building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and
              MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires
              to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results
              suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity
              rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to
              fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the
              number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the
              conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally,
              nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most
              still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design
              communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because
              many of the participants had substantial prior experience
              constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed
              the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size
              limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the
              contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a
              proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for
              communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not
              currently observed through the use of a paper-based communication
              methods.",

  abstract  = "A New York Times Bestseller A revolution is under way. In recent
               years, Google's autonomous cars have logged thousands of miles
               on American highways and IBM's Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies---with hardware,
               software, and networks at their core---will in the near future
               diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply
               enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many
               tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age
               MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee---two thinkers at the
               forefront of their field---reveal the forces driving the
               reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of
               digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in
               the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced
               infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items
               that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching
               change. Professions of all kinds---from lawyers to truck
               drivers---will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to
               transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift:
               fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as
               productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and
               up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the
               best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity.
               These include revamping education so that it prepares people for
               the next economy instead of the last one, designing new
               collaborations that pair brute processing power with human
               ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically
               transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The
               Second Machine Age will alter how we think about issues of
               technological, societal, and economic progress.",

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and
               the opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and
               design. It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various
               technological trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon
               future urban, spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within
               architecture. The future is already here. Now is the time to

  abstract  = "The digital revolution in education is well under way, with more
               and more learners plugged into the online world. How can schools
               make the most of both the technology and the learning potential
               of today's ``born digital'' students? In this new edition of
               their groundbreaking book, Collins and Halverson argue that new
               technologies have transformed our workplaces, our lives, and our
               culture and it is time we take the next step to transform
               learning---in and out of schools. The authors show how, over
               time, public schooling was so successful that it became
               synonymous with education. But new technologies risk making
               schools obsolete and this book explains why and how today's
               educators, policymakers, and communities must adapt to provide
               all learners with access to the new learning tools of the 21st
               century.",

                 evidence of its efficacy and substantial evidence of its

                 Taking a Bourdieusian approach, we propose that setting can be
                 understood as a practice through which the social and cultural
                 reproduction of dominant power relations is enacted within
                 schools. Drawing on survey data from 12,178 Year 7 (age 11/12)
                 students and discussion groups and individual interviews with
                 33 students, conducted as part of a wider project on secondary
                 school grouping practices, we examine the views of students
                 who experience setting, exploring the extent to which the
                 legitimacy of the practice is accepted or challenged, focusing
                 on students' negative views about setting. Analyses show that
                 privileged students (White, middle class) were most likely to
                 be in top sets whereas working‐class and Black students were
                 more likely to be in bottom sets. Students in the lowest sets
                 (and boys, Black students and those in receipt of free school
                 meals) were the most likely to express negative views of
                 setting and to question the legitimacy and `fairness' of
                 setting as a practice, whereas top‐set students defended the
                 legitimacy of setting and set allocations as `natural' and
                 `deserved'. This paper argues that setting is incompatible
                 with social justice approaches to education and calls for the
                 foregrounding of the views of those who are disadvantaged by
                 the practice as a tool for challenging the doxa of setting.",

               field trial protocol. Although this process varies by country,
               the underlying principles are universal. While this process is
               often a formality, for field research or lab-based studies with
               vulnerable users, formal ethics requirements can be challenging
               to navigate -- a common occurrence in the social sciences; yet,

               more accurately capture the particularities of such field-based

                 financial challenges faced by the Research Councils and the UK
                 Government has accelerated this shift, creating an urgent need
                 to explore both its potential and hazards for a range of
                 studies. While some progress in carrying out large-scale
                 complex social surveys on the web has been made, there is
                 still no consensus about how this can best be achieved while
                 maintaining population representativeness and preserving data
                 quality. To address this problem, the NCRM funded a network of
                 methodological innovation ``Web Surveys for the General
                 Population: How, Why and When?'' (also known by its acronym
                 GenPopWeb). A key objective of the network's activities was to
                 review and synthesise existing knowledge about the use of
                 web-based data collection for general population samples and

               remains underdeveloped in a number of areas including definition

  abstract = "Learning Analytics is an emerging research field and design
              discipline which occupies the `middle space' between the learning
              sciences/educational research, and the use of computational
              techniques to capture and analyse data (Suthers and Verbert,
              2013). We propose that the literature examining the triadic
              relationships between epistemology (the nature of knowledge),
              pedagogy (the nature of learning and teaching) and assessment
              provide critical considerations for bounding this middle space.
              We provide examples to illustrate the ways in which the
              understandings of particular analytics are informed by this
              triad. As a detailed worked example of how one might design
              analytics to scaffold a specific form of higher order learning,
              we focus on the construct of epistemic beliefs: beliefs about the
              nature of knowledge. We argue that analytics grounded in a
              pragmatic, sociocultural perspective are well placed to explore
              this construct using discourse-centric technologies. The examples
              provided throughout this paper, through emphasising the
              consideration of intentional design issues in the middle space,

                  the environment. The wizards provided support using a script

                  purpose their communication capacity in order to simulate the
                  actual system. Our results indicate that the feedback

                  think-aloud significantly more than in past interactions and

                  Additional results from student perception questionnaires
                  show that overall students find the system suggestions

                  thinking aloud to the computer but, as expected, some find

               Virtual reality is able to effectively blur the line between
               reality and illusion, granting us access to any experience

               researching the psychological effects of VR to help readers
               understand its upsides and possible downsides. He offers expert
               guidelines for interacting with VR, and describes the profound
               ways this technology can be put to use to hone our performance,
               help us recover from trauma, improve our learning, and even

                conversational systems react to inappropriate requests, such as
                bullying and sexual harassment on the part of the user, by
                collecting and analysing the novel \#MeTooAlexa corpus. Our
                results show that commercial systems mainly avoid answering,
                while rulebased chatbots show a variety of behaviours and often
                deflect. Data-driven systems, on the other hand, are often
                non-coherent, but also run the risk of being interpreted as
                flirtatious and sometimes react with counter-aggression. This
                includes our own system, trained on ``clean'' data, which
                suggests that inappropriate system behaviour is not caused by

               have developed a new interest in creating or strengthening the
               vocational part of the educational system, both at the basic and
               higher education level. These developments ask for a sound
               scientific underpinning of policy decisions and have therefore
               created a new need for empirically oriented academic research in
               VET issues. The new journal will address VET-specific questions
               from different academic disciplines emphasizing empirical work
               that fulfils highest methodological and statistical standards of
               research. The journal Empirical Research in Vocational Education
               and Training will follow developments throughout the world in
               vocational training institutions and companies. The journal
               welcomes comparative studies that allow to empirically compare
               the effectiveness, efficiency and equity in different VET
               systems at the school-, company and systemic level. The journal
               has the goal to cover a broad range of topics in the VET field
               from all relevant scientific disciplines. The journal has
               therefore an international pluridisciplinary editorial board and
               also an advisory board with leading international academics in
               the fields of pedagogy, psychology, sociology and economics. The
               targeted audience of the journal are academics and researchers
               in the field of VET. In addition the empirical orientation of
               the journal should make it and interesting source of information
               for policy-makers, policy planners and administrators,
               school-leaders and trainers in the field of VET. Empirical
               Research in Vocational Education and Training publishes
               empirical work in all fields of VET from basic VET to continuous
               or adult learning. All contributions are peer reviewed by at

               development of the twenty-first century. Within two decades,
               aspects of daily human life will be unrecognizable. AI will
               generate unprecedented wealth, revolutionize medicine and
               education through human-machine symbiosis, and create brand new

               routine work, however, AI will also challenge the organizing
               principles of our economic and social order. Meanwhile, AI will
               bring new risks in the form of autonomous weapons and smart
               technology that inherits human bias. AI is at a tipping point,

              Evolution is the first of two books that disseminate new and
              systematic knowledge on the strengths and weaknesses of the
              different models of vocational education and training (VET) in
              four Nordic countries. Vocational education in Europe has
              resisted standardisation to a higher degree than other fields of
              education, and during the last decade, there has been a growth in
              international, comparative VET research. While the Nordic
              countries provide an ideal case for comparative education
              studies, the literature in English on the Nordic VET systems is
              at present very limited. This first book provides thorough
              examinations of VET in Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Finland over
              150 years. Each section examines the historical evolution of VET
              at upper secondary level in one of the four Nordic countries.
              Contributors also analyse how each country have tried to reform
              their respective VET systems, and compare the paths which each
              nation has taken. The book explores what can be learned from the
              diversity of the VET-systems in the Nordic countries, which
              otherwise have many similarities and share a common heritage in
              education policy. This volume will help strengthen the knowledge
              base required for transnational policy learning, and for
              developing vocational education internationally for the future.
              It will be of interest to researchers, academics and postgraduate
              students involved in the study of vocational education,
              educational studies and educational policy, education planners

              machines in use, the less important it is to have one. These
              network effects influence consumer decisions and affect
              companies' ability to compete. Strategists have developed some
              well-known rules for navigating business environments with
              network effects. ``Move first'' is one, and ``get big fast'' is
              another. In a study of dozens of companies, however, the authors
              found that quite often the conventional wisdom was dead wrong.
              And when the rules failed, the reason was always the same:
              Companies trip up when they try to attract large volumes of
              customers without understanding (1) the strength of mutual
              attraction among various customer groups and (2) the extent of
              asymmetric attraction among them. Looking at examples such as
              TripAdvisor, Wikipedia, and the New York Times, the authors offer
              strategies for competing in markets with network effects. New
              entrants should focus on customer groups that they are uniquely
              positioned to serve or appeal to the most attractive customers in
              a market. Incumbents pursuing growth strategies in adjacent

               fashioned artificial intelligence,'' which is based not on heaps
               of data but on understanding commonsense intelligence. This kind
               of artificial intelligence is equipped to handle situations that
               depart from previous patterns---as we do in real life, when, for
               example, we encounter a washed-out bridge or when the barista
               informs us there's no more soy milk. Levesque considers the role
               of language in learning. He argues that a computer program that
               passes the famous Turing Test could be a mindless zombie, and he
               proposes another way to test for intelligence---the Winograd
               Schema Test, developed by Levesque and his colleagues. ``If our
               goal is to understand intelligent behavior, we had better
               understand the difference between making it and faking it,'' he
               observes. He identifies a possible mechanism behind common sense
               and the capacity to call on background knowledge: the ability to
               represent objects of thought symbolically. As AI migrates more
               and more into everyday life, we should worry if systems without
               common sense are making decisions where common sense is needed.",

               sentence--a mathematically consistent algorithm incapable of
               empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and error?
               What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between
               one programmed to save as many lives as possible and another
               that prioritizes the lives of its own passengers? And would you
               agree to share your family's full medical history if you were
               told that it would help researchers find a cure for cancer?These
               are just some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as
               we approach the age of the algorithm, when it feels as if the
               machines reign supreme. Already, these lines of code are telling
               us what to watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to
               send to jail. But as we rely on algorithms to automate big,
               important decisions--in crime, justice, healthcare,
               transportation, and money--they raise questions about what we
               want our world to look like. What matters most: Helping doctors
               with diagnosis or preserving privacy? Protecting victims of
               crime or preventing innocent people being falsely accused? Hello
               World takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the
               downright ugly of the algorithms that surround us on a daily
               basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner workings,
               showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and
               demonstrates the ways in which human bias can literally be
               written into the code. By weaving in relatable, real world
               stories with accessible explanations of the underlying
               mathematics that power algorithms, Hello World helps us to
               determine their power, expose their limitations, and examine

  author    = "Epstein, David J",
  abstract  = "Plenty of experts argue that anyone who wants to develop a
               skill, play an instrument, or lead their field should start
               early, focus intensely, and rack up as many hours of deliberate
               practice as possible. If you dabble or delay, you'll never catch
               up to the people who got a head start. But if you take a closer
               look at the world's top performers, from professional athletes
               to Nobel laureates, you'll find that early specialization is the
               exception, not the rule. David Epstein, author of the New York
               Times bestseller The Sports Gene, studied the world's most
               successful athletes, artists, musicians, inventors, forecasters
               and scientists. He discovered that in most fields--especially
               those that are complex and unpredictable--generalists, not
               specialists, are primed to excel. Generalists often find their
               path late, and they juggle many interests rather than focusing
               on one. They're also more creative, more agile, and able to make
               connections their more specialized peers can't spy from deep in
               their hyperfocused trenches. As experts silo themselves further
               while computers master more of the skills once reserved for
               highly focused humans, people who think broadly and embrace
               diverse experiences and perspectives will increasingly thrive.
               Our obsession with getting a head start is understandable; early
               specialization feels efficient. But Epstein marshals an enormous
               body of scientific research to argue that we should all actively
               cultivate inefficiency. Failing a test is the best way to learn.
               Frequent quitters end up with the most fulfilling careers. The
               most impactful inventors cross domains rather than deepening
               their knowledge in a single area. Provocative, rigorous, and
               engrossing, Range explains how to maintain the benefits of
               breadth, diverse experience, interdisciplinary thinking, and
               delayed concentration in a world that increasingly incentivizes,
               even demands, hyperspecialization.",

               at the identification of personal and/or situational factors
               that contribute to PhD candidates' attrition and persistence,
               respectively. By doing so, the literature has adopted a rather
               passive perspective towards PhD candidates and their
               development. The active role of candidates being agentic
               constructors of their academic career has been widely neglected.
               This study therefore focuses on how PhD students can take an
               active approach towards their academic development. A
               qualitative interview study with ten German faculty members was
               conducted to answer the following research questions: (1) How do
               supervisors conceptualise academic success of PhD students? (2)
               How does professional agency affect academic success of young
               researchers? (3) What individual and/or contextual factors

               interviews, evidence is reported on how doctoral candidates can
               indeed affect their academic development and eventually their
               success by exercising professional agency. Among others, the

               put away your moral compass, and smarter to think like a child.
               You will be given a master class in incentives-because for
               better or worse, incentives rule our world. And you will learn

  abstract  = "Construction workers' ability to identify and assess risks is
               acquired through training and experience and is among the key
               factors that determine their behaviour and thus their safety.
               Yet researchers have questioned the effectiveness of
               conventional safety training. This research tested the
               hypotheses that safety training in a virtual reality (VR)
               construction site would be feasible and more effective, in terms
               of workers' learning and recall in identifying and assessing
               construction safety risks, than would equivalent training using
               conventional methods. Sixty-six subjects were provided training
               in construction safety and their safety knowledge was tested
               prior to the training, immediately afterward, and one month
               later. Half of the subjects received traditional classroom
               training with visual aids; the other half were trained using a
               3D immersive VR power-wall. Significant advantage was found for
               VR training for stone cladding work and for cast-in-situ
               concrete work, but not for general site safety. VR training was
               more effective in terms of maintaining trainees' attention and
               concentration. Training with VR was more effective over time,
               especially in the context of cast-in-situ concrete works. Given
               the need for improved training and the advantages of training
               using VR, incorporation of VR in construction safety training is
               strongly recommended.",

               attention in recent years, the term AR was given different
               meanings by varying researchers. In this article, we first
               provide an overview of definitions, taxonomies, and technologies
               of AR. We argue that viewing AR as a concept rather than a type
               of technology would be more productive for educators,
               researchers, and designers. Then we identify certain features
               and affordances of AR systems and applications. Yet, these
               compelling features may not be unique to AR applications and can
               be found in other technological systems or learning environments
               (e.g., ubiquitous and mobile learning environments). The
               instructional approach adopted by an AR system and the alignment
               among technology design, instructional approach, and learning
               experiences may be more important. Thus, we classify three
               categories of instructional approaches that emphasize the
               ``roles,'' ``tasks,'' and ``locations,'' and discuss what and
               how different categories of AR approaches may help students
               learn. While AR offers new learning opportunities, it also
               creates new challenges for educators. We outline technological,
               pedagogical, learning issues related to the implementation of AR
               in education. For example, students in AR environments may be
               cognitively overloaded by the large amount of information they
               encounter, the multiple technological devices they are required
               to use, and the complex tasks they have to complete. This
               article provides possible solutions for some of the challenges

  abstract  = "Three-dimensional (3D) virtual worlds hold the users' attention
               by providing rich interaction in an environment similar to the
               real world. User engagement duration is known to increase in
               environments with intense interaction. However, information in
               the literature about whether gender, experience, or spatial
               ability affects interaction in these environments is limited. In
               this study, these three factors are compared to users' depth of
               interaction in a 3D virtual world. In addition, the
               relationships between engagement duration, spatial ability, and
               depth of interaction are examined to investigate whether the
               first two factors can predict the third. Findings showed that
               users' depth of interaction was not influenced by gender, but
               experience and spatial ability did affect interaction. A strong
               relationship was determined between depth of interaction and
               engagement duration, and a moderate relationship was found
               between depth of interaction and spatial ability. Findings
               indicated that when designing 3D environments, it is important

                     tangible/embodied interactions (TEI) and virtual reality

                     But very few VR-TEI systems are specifically designed to

  abstract  = "Purpose-- Using Michel Foucault's notion of heterotopia as a
               guide, the purpose of this paper is to explore the implications
               of considering the library as place, and specifically as a place
               that has the ``curious property of being in relation with all
               the other sites, but in such a way as to suspect, neutralize, or
               invent the set of relations that they happen to designate,
               mirror, or reflect'' (Foucault, 1986a, p.
               24).Design/methodology/approach-- The paper draws upon a range
               of literary examples and from biographical accounts of authors
               such as Alan Bennett, Michel Foucault, and Umberto Eco to show
               how the library space operates as a heterotopia.Findings-- The
               paper finds that drawing together the constructs of heterotopia
               and serendipity can enrich the understanding of how libraries
               are experienced as sites of play, creativity, and
               adventure.Originality/value-- Foucault's concept of heterotopia
               is offered as an original and useful frame that can account for
               the range of experiences and associations uniquely attached to
               the library.",

               smarter than the lone thinker; where you think matters just as

               Renaissance to satellites, medical breakthroughs to social
               media, Charles Darwin to Marconi, Steven Johnson shows how, by

               traditional education method in aviation safety",

  abstract  = "Thanks to the increasing availability of consumer head-mounted
               displays, educational applications of immersive VR could now
               reach to the general public, especially if they include gaming
               elements (immersive serious games). Safety education of citizens
               could be a particularly promising domain for immersive serious
               games, because people tend not to pay attention to and benefit
               from current safety materials. In this paper, we propose an
               HMD-based immersive game for educating passengers about aviation
               safety that allows players to experience a serious aircraft
               emergency with the goal of surviving it. We compare the proposed
               approach to a traditional aviation safety education method (the
               safety card) used by airlines. Unlike most studies of VR for
               safety knowledge acquisition, we do not focus only on assessing
               learning immediately after the experience but we extend our
               attention to knowledge retention over a longer time span. This
               is a fundamental requirement, because people need to retain
               safety procedures in order to apply them when faced with danger.
               A knowledge test administered before, immediately after and one
               week after the experimental condition showed that the immersive
               serious game was superior to the safety card. Moreover,
               subjective as well as physiological measurements employed in the
               study showed that the immersive serious game was more engaging
               and fear-arousing than the safety card, a factor that can
               contribute to explain the obtained superior retention, as we

               for new forms of learning. Changes in technology-enhanced
               professional learning are influenced by the inter-relationship
               of work practices, learning processes and technology systems.
               Based on an analysis of current research in professional
               learning with technologies, we identify a number of important
               trends. First, work practice tends to be agile and constantly
               changing so professionals are tending to use technologies to
               support just-in-time learning alongside formal professional
               training and education. Second, with widespread adoption of
               digital media in society, there appears to be increasing
               reliance on recommendations from AI systems for learning
               alongside guidance from workplace mentors or experts. Third,
               employers and employees want to find ways to extend assessment
               of formal educational qualifications through accreditation of
               the outcomes of informal, work-integrated learning. To shape the
               ongoing transformation of both work(places) and learning, the
               chapter highlights the ways diverse disciplines need to align
               reflectively, critically, and constructively to bring together
               theories and methods from learning sciences, computer science
               and human-computer interaction to identify problems and engineer
               solutions. Finally, we propose three constructs that are
               critical for technology-enhanced professional learning, but
               often are not taken into consideration: the goals and
               motivations of learners, the work environment and structure, and
               the tools and resources available for work and learning.",

               done in the subject of learning by modeling and offers an
               extensive review of the major theories, edited by one of the
               most influential psychologists of his generation. In his
               introductory essay, Bandura identifies the most important
               controversial issues in the field of observational learning and
               reviews a large body of research findings, before carefully
               chosen articles, written by a team of expert contributors,
               tackle a range of key debates in the field. Topics explored
               include the role of reinforcement play in observational
               learning, the scope of modeling influences, the types of people
               most susceptible to modeling influences, and the relative
               effectiveness of models presented in live action, in pictorial
               presentations, or through verbal description. Written in a
               lively and engaging manner, this book will be of interest to all
               psychology students interested in psychological modeling, as
               well as educators and professionals working with children.",

               research, design principles, and examples e-Learning and the
               Science of Instruction is the ultimate handbook for
               evidence-based e-learning design. Since the first edition of
               this book, e-learning has grown to account for at least 40\% of
               all training delivery media. However, digital courses often fail
               to reach their potential for learning effectiveness and
               efficiency. This guide provides research-based guidelines on how
               best to present content with text, graphics, and audio as well
               as the conditions under which those guidelines are most
               effective. This updated fourth edition describes the guidelines,
               psychology, and applications for ways to improve learning
               through personalization techniques, coherence, animations, and a
               new chapter on evidence-based game design. The chapter on the
               Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning introduces three forms
               of cognitive load which are revisited throughout each chapter as
               the psychological basis for chapter principles. A new chapter on
               engagement in learning lays the groundwork for in-depth reviews
               of how to leverage worked examples, practice, online
               collaboration, and learner control to optimize learning. The
               updated instructor's materials include a syllabus, assignments,
               storyboard projects, and test items that you can adapt to your
               own course schedule and students. Co-authored by the most
               productive instructional research scientist in the world, Dr.
               Richard E. Mayer, this book distills copious e-learning research
               into a practical manual for improving learning through optimal
               design and delivery. Get up to date on the latest e-learning
               research Adopt best practices for communicating information
               effectively Use evidence-based techniques to engage your
               learners Replace popular instructional ideas, such as learning
               styles with evidence-based guidelines Apply evidence-based
               design techniques to optimize learning games e-Learning
               continues to grow as an alternative or adjunct to the classroom,
               and correspondingly, has become a focus among researchers in
               learning-related fields. New findings from research laboratories
               can inform the design and development of e-learning. However,
               much of this research published in technical journals is
               inaccessible to those who actually design e-learning material.
               By collecting the latest evidence into a single volume and
               translating the theoretical into the practical, e-Learning and

  title     = "Methodology: Who Needs It?",
  author    = "Hammersley, Martyn",
  abstract  = "The literature on social science methods and the issues
               surrounding them has grown massively and continues to increase.
               Yet many social scientists are ambivalent about methodology. For
               some, it plays a central, perhaps even an all-encompassing,
               role; while, for others, it is desirable only in small amounts,
               or indeed is regarded as an irrelevance, as a distraction from
               actually doing research. In this book, Hammersley argues that,
               in large part, this reflects and is part of a wider problem: the
               gradual decline of a previously influential academic model of
               inquiry. This has occurred as a result of ideological challenges
               and the erosion of the institutional conditions that support
               academic work. He defends this model, spelling out the demands
               it places upon social scientists, and examining such issues as
               the proper role of methodology, the nature of objectivity, the
               false idea that social scientists should be intellectuals or
               social critics, the dialectic of academic discussion, the ethics
               of belief, and the limits of academic freedom. More broadly, he
               also questions the role of the social research within society
               and what it means to be a social scientist in the 21st century.
               Hammersley′s book is engagingly written and controversial. It

  abstract  = "From the Rust Belt to Silicon Valley, the intersection between
               architecture and industry has provided a rich and evolving
               source for historians of architecture. In a historical context,
               industrial architecture evokes the smoking factories of the
               nineteenth century or Fordist production complexes of the
               twentieth century. This book documents the changing nature of
               industrial building and planning from the end of the nineteenth
               century to the beginning of the twenty-first century. Drawing on
               research from the United States, Europe and Australia, this
               collection of essays highlights key moments in industrial
               architecture and planning representative of the wider paradigms
               in the field. Areas of analysis include industrial production,
               factories, hydroelectricity, aerospace, logistics, finance,
               scientific research and mining. The selected case studies serve
               to highlight architectural and planning innovations in industry
               and their contributions to wider cultural and societal currents.
               This richly illustrated collection will be of interest for a
               wide range of built environment studies, incorporating findings

               range of methods that can be applied in any study, Strategies of
               Qualitative Inquiry covers funding, case studies, ethnography,
               grounded theory, participative inquiry and much more - offering
               a range of methods that can be employed in any study. The
               outstanding contributors thoroughly covereach topic, enriching
               the qualitative experience. The Handbook of Qualitative Research
               has been heralded as the state of the art in evaluating the
               field of qualitative inquiry and features contributions from
               some of the leading scholars in the area. Now published in

              discovery of any shortcoming or problem associated with concrete

              considerable public concern -- both from a safety perspective and

               psychological concepts have become more and more important to
               enable us to understand entrepreneurship. A general model is
               presented which argues that personality and human capital
               (education, experience) factors have a function via goals and
               action strategies on success. The same is also true of the
               environment. In earlier times, personality factors were
               emphasized by psychological researchers on entrepreneurship.
               There are good reasons to do this; however, modern research goes
               beyond this and differentiates more sharply between emergence of
               firms and firm success, and looks in more detail at
               contingencies between person and environmental factors. The
               actions of the entrepreneur are crucial for the firm's chances
               to survive and thrive in the market. All those psychological
               constructs that are near to actions---for example, goals and

               enrolled in the Virginia Community College System in Fall 2004
               using a classic Mincerian approach. Consistent with previous
               studies, we find positive returns to college-level credits, even

               and bachelor's degree receipt but no consistently positive
               sheepskin effects for short-term and long-term certificates.

               differentiated results, both in terms of returns to credits and

               Education critically analyses the specific challenges relating

               as the diverse nature of learners and the variety of educational
               contexts. It focuses on the journeys to becoming teacher
               educators, their relevant teaching know-how and professional
               needs. This book combines theoretical frameworks with both
               qualitative and quantitative data to outline the pathways,
               professional identities, knowledge, and continuous professional
               development of teacher educators. This data is used to discuss
               the four main themes. The first deals with the teacher
               educators' initial disciplinary areas, journey-making to be
               educators, and the current titles/positions. The next one
               delineates the know-how (knowledge, experiences, capacities and
               skill sets) to perform as teacher educators. The third one
               relates to their professional identities and the final topic,

               Contributing to the field of further and vocational education,

  abstract  = "Informal Learning, Practitioner Inquiry and Occupational
               Education explores how practitioners in a variety of occupations
               perform their jobs and argues that working and learning are
               intricately connected. Drawing on theories around working and
               learning in informal, formal and lifelong settings, the book
               gives insights into how workers negotiate their occupational
               practices. The book investigates four related concepts --
               informal learning, practitioner inquiry, occupational education
               and epistemological perspectives. The combinations of theories
               and empirical case studies are used to provide a conceptual
               framework of inquiry where knowledge, abilities, experiences and
               skill sets play a significant aspect. It presents 11 case
               studies of professions ranging from conventional occupations of
               acting, detective work, international road transportation to
               emerging professions of boardroom consultancy, nutritional

               business, medicine, education, government---and the quality of
               our livesToday, organizations of all kinds are ruled by the
               belief that the path to success is quantifying human
               performance, publicizing the results, and dividing up the
               rewards based on the numbers. But in our zeal to instill the
               evaluation process with scientific rigor, we've gone from
               measuring performance to fixating on measuring itself---and this
               tyranny of metrics now threatens the quality of our
               organizations and lives. In this brief, accessible, and powerful
               book, Jerry Muller uncovers the damage metrics are causing and
               shows how we can begin to fix the problem. Filled with examples
               from business, medicine, education, government, and other
               fields, the book explains why paying for measured performance
               doesn't work, why surgical scorecards may increase deaths, and
               much more. But Muller also shows that, when used as a complement
               to judgment based on personal experience, metrics can be
               beneficial, and he includes an invaluable checklist of when and
               how to use them. The result is an essential corrective to a
               harmful trend that increasingly affects us all.",

               progress'' as only he can. But Factfulness does much more than

               Factfulness: The stress-reducing habit of only carrying opinions
               for which you have strong supporting facts. When asked simple
               questions about global trends - why the world's population is
               increasing; how many young women go to school; how many of us
               live in poverty - we systematically get the answers wrong. So
               wrong that a chimpanzee choosing answers at random will
               consistently outguess journalists, Nobel laureates, and
               investment bankers. In Factfulness, Professor of International

               with his two long-time collaborators Anna and Ola, offers a
               radical new explanation of why this happens, and reveals the ten
               instincts that distort our perspective. It turns out that the
               world, for all its imperfections, is in a much better state than
               we might think. But when we worry about everything all the time
               instead of embracing a worldview based on facts, we can lose our
               ability to focus on the things that threaten us most. Inspiring

               seek to leverage industry 4.0 principles for the digitalization
               and industrialization of construction. In addition to new
               technologies, these firms also bring new business models that
               depart from the project-based tendering system found in
               traditional construction. The first new business model is
               vertical integration. These firms are structured as integrated
               hierarchical firms, keeping control of product architecture and
               processes in-house. These firms control production by developing
               their own off-site factories. The second new business model is
               digital systems integration. These firms leverage an integrated
               cloud-based product configurator to enable mass customization.
               Using principles of capital-light industry 4.0 supply chains,
               digital system integrators can manufacture parts from periphery
               supply chain partners suppliers, including new sectors such as
               automotive, aerospace, manufacturing or industrial. The third
               new business model is the transformation of an existing
               project-based business toward industrialized construction
               through the creation of a spinoff factories. The chapter

  author    = "Callon, Michel",
  abstract  = "Slicing through blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon
               presents a rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of
               how everyday market activity gets produced.If you're convinced
               you know what a market is, think again. In his long-awaited
               study, French sociologist and engineer Michel Callon takes us to
               the heart of markets, to the unsung processes that allow
               innovations to become robust products and services. Markets in
               the Making begins with the observation that stable commercial
               transactions are more enigmatic, more elusive, and more involved
               than previously described by economic theory. Slicing through
               blunt theories of supply and demand, Callon presents a
               rigorously researched but counterintuitive model of market
               activity that emphasizes what people designing products or
               launching startups soon discover---the inherent difficulties of
               connecting individuals to things. Callon's model is founded upon
               the notion of ``singularization,'' the premise that goods and
               services must adapt and be adapted to the local milieu of every
               individual whose life they enter. Person by person, thing by
               thing, Callon demonstrates that for ordinary economic
               transactions to emerge en masse, singular connections must be
               made.Pushing us to see markets as more than abstract interfaces
               where pools of anonymous buyers and sellers meet, Callon draws
               our attention to the exhaustively creative practices that market
               professionals continuously devise to entangle people and things.
               Markets in the Making exemplifies how prototypes, fragile
               curiosities that have only just been imagined, are gradually
               honed into predictable objects and practices. Once these are
               active enough to create a desired effect, yet passive enough to
               be transferred from one place to another without disruption,
               they will have successfully achieved the status of ``goods'' or
               ``services.'' The output of this more ample process of
               innovation, as redefined by Callon, is what we recognize as
               ``the market''---commercial activity, at scale.The capstone of
               an influential research career at the forefront of science and
               technology studies, Markets in the Making coherently integrates
               the empirical perspective of product engineering with the values
               of the social sciences. After masterfully redescribing how
               markets are made, Callon culminates with a strong empirical
               argument for why markets can and should be harnessed to enact
               social change. His is a theory of markets that serves social
               critique.",

               recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But
               somewhat ironically, his theory of development has never been
               well understood in the West. Mind in Society should correct much
               of this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of
               outstanding Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique
               selection of Vygotsky's important essays, most of which have
               previously been unavailable in English.The Vygotsky who emerges
               from these pages can no longer be glibly included among the
               neobehaviorists. In these essays he outlines a
               dialectical-materialist theory of cognitive development that
               anticipates much recent work in American social science. The
               mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be understood in isolation from
               the surrounding society. Man is the only animal who uses tools
               to alter his own inner world as well as the world around him.
               From the handkerchief knotted as a simple mnemonic device to the
               complexities of symbolic language, society provides the
               individual with technology that can be used to shape the private
               processes of mind. In Mind in Society Vygotsky applies this
               theoretical framework to the development of perception,
               attention, memory, language, and play, and he examines its
               implications for education. The result is a remarkably
               interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky's relevance to
               modern psychological thought.",

               scaffolding; ground stability and foundations; floors, walls,
               doors, windows, roofs, stairs, and ramps; surface finishes;
               internal environment and energy supply; and water supply and
               sanitation. Deals with design, technology, site assembly, and
               environmental issues of domestic and residential buildings
               Thoroughly updated, with particular attention paid to the
               concept of building efficiency and improved integration of the
               topics covered to match current student needs New ``at a

                 the new focus in many K--12 learning environments.
                 Nonetheless, few people understand what personalized learning
                 really means and even fewer can design and implement a
                 personalized learning environment appropriate for all
                 learners, especially learners with disabilities. This 18-month
                 descriptive research study focused on identifying the design
                 characteristics of personalized learning environments and the
                 initial results of these environments. Findings indicate that
                 personalized learning environments require more than
                 technology, that the technology itself is simply a tool to
                 support implementation. These personalized learning

                 Universal Design for Learning at the cornerstone of practice.

               the dominant assumptions regarding human action and

               intelligence. Lucy Suchman argues that the planning model of
               interaction favoured by the majority of AI researchers does not
               take sufficient account of the situatedness of most human social
               behaviour. The problems that can arise as a result are
               pertinently, and often amusingly, illustrated by the careful
               analysis of a recorded interaction between novice users and an
               intelligent machine, whose design has failed to accommodate
               essential resources of successful human communication. Plans and
               Situated Actions presents a compelling case for the
               re-examination of current models underlying interface design.
               Lucy Suchman's proposals for a fresh characterisation of
               human-computer interaction which also incorporates recent
               insights from the social sciences provides a challenge that

               --- or, more accurately, multiple housing crises. A massive
               housing shortage in major cities has resulted in skyrocketing
               rents. Low- and middle-income individuals find themselves priced
               out of the places with the most opportunity. Homelessness is
               rampant in cities across the country. Developers often face the

                 responsivity of vocational education. Responsivity is defined
                 as the ability of vocational education and training (VET) to
                 interpret socioeconomic and technological developments for
                 curriculum design in terms of content and pedagogical
                 approach. VET needs to equip young people with the knowledge,
                 skills, and confidence to engage in work and make a difference
                 in the transformation of work. This chapter argues that
                 learners have to be provided with opportunities to actively
                 engage in innovation at work to experience what is needed to
                 deal with uncertainty and to organize their own learning in
                 such circumstances. In the Netherlands, the challenges of
                 building regional networks and participating in regional
                 innovation are being taken up by higher professional education
                 (HPE). This chapter describes the promising approach developed
                 in the Netherlands, which focuses on innovative work-based
                 learning to strengthen responsivity.",

               Lorna",
  abstract  = "Interest in learning at work has captured the attention of many
               people around the world, often taking centre stage in policy
               debates about improving economic performance, prosperity and
               well-being. This book is about the learning that goes on in
               workplaces {\^a}e`` ranging from offices, factories and shops to
               gyms, health centres and universities {\^a}e'' and how it can be
               improved. Such learning includes everyday work activity,
               on-the-job instruction and off-the-job training events.
               Improving Working as Learning is the first book to analyze
               systematically learning at work in different settings by
               developing and applying a new analytical framework. The Working
               as Learning Framework connects the particularities of work tasks
               with the way jobs are organized and the wider pressures and
               constraints organizations face for survival, growth and
               development. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the
               framework offers a sophisticated understanding of how improving
               the work environment {\^a}e`` both within the workplace and
               beyond {\^a}e'' can enhance and sustain improvements in learning
               at work. Each chapter presents evidence {\^a}e`` taken from both
               private and public sectors {\^a}e'' to illustrate how the
               Working as Learning Framework provides a means by which
               employers, researchers and policy-makers can Improve the
               conditions for nurturing and sustaining learning at workBuild
               appropriate workforce development plans within given

  abstract  = "Activity theory -- a conceptual framework originally developed
               by Aleksei Leontiev -- has its roots in the socio-cultural
               tradition in Russian psychology. The foundational concept of the
               theory is human activity, which is understood as purposeful,
               mediated, and transformative interaction between human beings
               and the world. Since the early 1990s, activity theory has been a
               visible landmark in the theoretical landscape of Human-Computer
               Interaction (HCI). Along with some other frameworks, such as
               distributed cognition and phenomenology, it established itself
               as a leading post-cognitivist approach in HCI and interaction
               design. In this book we discuss the conceptual foundations of
               activity theory and its contribution to HCI research. After
               making the case for theory in HCI and briefly discussing the
               contribution of activity theory to the field (Chapter One) we
               introduce the historical roots, main ideas, and principles of
               activity theory (Chapter Two). After that we present in-depth
               analyses of three issues which we consider of special importance
               to current developments in HCI and interaction design, namely:
               agency (Chapter Three), experience (Chapter Four), and
               activity-centric computing (Chapter Five). We conclude the book
               with reflections on challenges and prospects for further
               development of activity theory in HCI (Chapter Six). Table of

  title     = "Developing a next-generation model for massive digital learning",
  author    = "Dede, Chris and Lidwell, William",
  abstract  = "A decade ago, massively open online courses (MOOCs) were
               heralded as the solution to universal, global access to higher
               education. While they failed to reach this vision, primarily
               because of teaching-by-telling and learning-by-listening (a PDF
               of the residential classroom), MOOCs provided the foundational
               models and infrastructure for emergency remote learning in the
               pandemic. Reports of remote learning's death post-pandemic are
               greatly exaggerated, since the world is now irreversibly
               hybrid---and will stay that way because many people and
               organizations value the new opportunities this presents. From
               now on, when students leave the shelter of classrooms to
               interact with the world beyond schooling, they must have skills
               for adept performance both face-to-face and across distance.
               Colleges, universities, and regions that force all teaching and
               learning to be face-to-face are dooming their graduates to
               reduced agency in every other aspect of life. As discussed in
               recent reports from Harvard, MIT, and Stanford, innovative
               approaches to digital learning were developed during the
               pandemic that are now improving campus-based learning. Insights
               from these approaches offer the opportunity for student
               engagement at scale, taking advantage of strengths of online
               instruction such as collapsing time, bridging space,
               personalizing via rich datastreams, using AI-based instructional
               assistants and learning partners, delivering content and
               experience across universities, and sustaining online learning
               communities after formal instruction ends. Combined, these
               advances can enable next-generation massive digital hybrid
               learning, a means to achieve the aspirational vision of
               universal global access to higher education. A coalition of
               higher education institutions could begin to realize this
               vision, an essential step in enabling all learners to survive
               and thrive in our increasingly turbulent, disruptive global

                 (VET). This new prospective approach is in contrast to the
                 existing skill-based retrospective approach, which has come to
                 dominate VET research and policymaking. VET has paid a price
                 for becoming overly institutionalized within national
                 education and training systems and, as a consequence, initial
                 preparation of young people for the labor market. We argue
                 that a close relationship to future work practice is vital to

                 vocational education necessitates placing individuals
                 centrally in those deliberations. The geneses of national
                 vocational education systems, and their form, goals, and
                 practices, are increasingly shaped by institutional factors,
                 which Dewey (1916) refers to as the ?social side.? They extend
                 to the provision of detailed national prespecified outcomes,
                 course content, forms of assessment, and so on. Yet, the
                 efficacy and continuity of these educational provisions arise
                 in response to how individuals engage, learn, and remake
                 them?what Dewey refers to as the ?personal side??albeit in
                 interdependent ways. That is, there is mutual dependence
                 between the personal and social sides. Regardless of whether
                 it is directed to pragmatic purposes or educational efficacy,
                 vocational education relies on individual experiencing and
                 engagement, interdependently. Ultimately, individuals enact
                 vocational education provisions, learn from and through them,
                 prompt changes within them, and realize their intended

              Bidders to the ahp will be required to note the types of mmc that

              bidders in that exercise, this note explains the mmc definition
              framework, and the types of construction that are currently
              encompassed within the seven categories of mmc. It should be
              noted that mmc is a rapidly evolving approach, and that the forms
              of construction in each of the categories may change over the
              course of the ahp. The gla will notify investment partners if the

               qualifications act as boundary objects in the stimulation of
               learning at work and how they, in turn, become the catalyst for
               the creation of artefacts that have a purpose and existence
               beyond the life cycle of an accreditation process. The context
               for the paper is the UK's automotive manufacturing industry, a
               sector that has undergone considerable change over the past
               thirty or so years and has been under intense pressure to
               improve standards. The paper presents evidence from case studies
               of two companies that produce parts for global car
               manufacturers. These companies have introduced competence-based
               approaches in order to audit and assess the skills of their
               workforces in response to demands from the companies they supply
               that they can prove their employees are working to the required
               international quality standards. The competence-based approach,
               which is contested in the academic literature, has enabled
               employees to gain National Vocational Qualifications (NVQs),
               which, in turn, are still controversial some twenty years after
               they were first introduced. The paper argues that a
               competence-based approach can be beneficial to both
               organisations and individuals, but the ambiguities inherent in
               the NVQ model of competence create tensions and opportunities
               for restrictive as well as expansive forms implementation.",

                 land use and associated CO2 emissions until 2100 using an

                 buildings with wooden constructions, 106 Gt of additional CO2

               theory methods shape qualitative interviewing in relation to
               personal narratives and guide analysis of interview data.
               Essentially, grounded theory methods consist of flexible
               strategies for focusing and expediting qualitative data
               collection and analysis. These methods provide a set of
               inductive steps that successively lead the researcher from
               studying concrete realities to rendering a conceptual
               understanding of them. The founders of grounded theory, Barney
               G. Glaser and Anselm L. Strauss (1967), aimed to develop
               middle-range theories from qualitative data. Hence they not only
               intended to conceptualize qualitative data, but planned to
               demonstrate relations between conceptual categories and to
               specify the conditions under which theoretical relationships

               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal
               dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and
               cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In
               this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and
               diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal
               Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter
               may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the
               former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive
               behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant
               feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the
               application of the approach, we designed and developed several
               key components of an intelligent learning environment for
               teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic
               surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical
               interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard
               validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to
               produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.",

               systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based
               on individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far
               superior to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors
               are `intelligent tutors' because they are able to continously
               adapt the content and style of their instruction to best meet
               the needs of the learner. The historical evolution of
               intelligent tutoring systems is presented. The starting point
               was programmed instruction in the late 1960s, followed by
               knowledge-based tutors that try to simulate good human tutors by
               the integrated use of domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and
               knowledge about the individual student. Finally some important
               current trends like distance learning, collaborative learning,
               and Web-based learning are outlined. The presentation is given
               within a cognitive science point of view. From this perspective

                  project-in its second year-is to incorporate practical
                  content in the construction curricula thus bridging the gap
                  between the classroom and the construction site. Enhancements
                  are being accomplished by developing 1) an Internet-based
                  Interactive Construction Management Learning System (ICMLS)
                  and 2) an advising and mentorship program that will enhance
                  practitioner-involvement. The Interactive Learning System
                  uses interactive and adaptive learning environments to train
                  students in the areas of construction methods, equipment and
                  processes. This system is being developed using multimedia;
                  Internet based computing; Virtual Reality Modeling Language
                  (VRML); databases; and discrete-event simulation. This paper

               effective form of instruction. Three contrasting hypotheses, a
               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
               effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as well
               as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further
               tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring
               tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to promote a more
               interactive style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style,
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Instead, tutors were encouraged to prompt the students.
               Surprisingly, students learned just as effectively even when
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Their learning in the interactive style of tutoring is
               attributed to construction from deeper and a greater amount of
               scaffolding episodes, as well as their greater effort to take

               Systems (ITSs) tailors direction, support, and feedback to
               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed
               to support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for
               military tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games
               including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these
               game-based desktop tutors have also been limited to adaptive
               instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and
               decision-making). The military requires adaptive instruction to
               extend beyond the desktop to be compatible with the physical
               nature of many tasks performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
               This article examines how commercial sensor technologies might
               be adapted to work with GIFT and support tailored
               computer-guided instruction in the psychomotor domain for a
               military medical training task, specifically hemorrhage control.
               Toward this goal, we evaluated the usability and system features
               of commercial smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies.
               Smart glasses were selected as the focus of this study over
               handheld mobile devices in order to promote a hands-free
               experience during the training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a
               mannequin. Pressure sensors were selected to provide direct
               measures of effectiveness during the application of tourniquets
               and pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses
               and pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
               other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
               adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s point-of-need
               and criteria based on established usability heuristics.
               Instruction in the wild is training provided in an environment

               infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of
               operation). We examined a wide range of features and
               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
               psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no

               world is neither a return to pre-pandemic normal nor a
               new-normal. Instead, we are now in Oz rather than Kansas,

               technophobes are hoping---no magical red slippers can bring us
               back to where we were. Understanding why this is the case and

               in lab settings. While lab studies can be insightful, they leave
               out the complexity of a classroom environment. We developed
               three AR learning environments that have been used in genuine
               classroom contexts, some of them being now part of classroom
               regular practices. These systems and the learning activities
               they provide have been co-designed with teachers, for their own
               classrooms, through multiple cycles of prototyping and testing.
               We present here the features that emerged from these co-design
               cycles and abstract them into design principles.",

               However, experience-based learning of dangerous situations is

  abstract = "Abstract The benefits of Building Information Modelling (BIM)
              have typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to
              enhance the process of information extraction from building
              information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
              workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated
              the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This
              research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness
              of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency
              through improving the information retrieval process during
              construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach
              was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a
              mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage
              capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop
              experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual
              information retrieval methods (control group), with information
              retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results
              revealed that the participants using the artefact were
              approximately 50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks,
              and committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
              This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing
              information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick
              Response markers can significantly improve the information
              retrieval process and that BIM and AR integration has the
              potential to enhance task efficiency.",

  abstract = "Purpose New methods to introduce topics in classrooms are needed
              to enhance the construction management educational experience.
              One of these new methods is showing real time videos that
              highlight the various elements of concern in the classroom
              lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality
              technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to
              simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal
              constraints of various construction processes. The
              superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to
              virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This
              enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to
              visualize context and hidden processes otherwise unattainable
              through traditional classroom lectures.
              Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved perception
              of reality is created through the combination of the learners'
              ability to understand the complexity of construction products
              (e.g. assemblies) and associated jobsite processes by viewing the
              real environment augmented with computer-generated information
              layers. Findings Testing the ART video in a classroom with
              undergraduate construction management students showed that
              students who were exposed to the ART video were able to remember
              and identify the highlighted elements in the corresponding
              assembly more effectively than those who were not.
              Originality/value ART is a valuable tool in enhancing classroom
              learning and gives educators a teaching advantage when they
              combine traditional classroom lectures with ART enabled media.",

              placing it in its theoretical-historical context. The paper
              discusses the connection between Vygotsky's Zone of Proximal
              Development (ZPD), and the notion of scaffolding, and explicates
              the differences between scaffolding and scaffolds. The paper then
              presents a discussion of the changes that the notion of
              scaffolding has undergone, especially when it comes to supporting
              students in classroom contexts. In classrooms where one teacher
              supports multiple students, scaffolding is distributed across
              various tools and social scaffolds. A discussion of the notion of
              distributed scaffolding is presented, to describe how students in
              classrooms may be supported by various tools and social
              scaffolds. The paper then introduces the kinds of distribution
              and interactions between tools and social scaffolds that need to
              be considered to support multiple students in classroom contexts.
              Finally, distributed scaffolding is discussed with reference to
              the key features of scaffolding, especially fading and transfer

              understandings of learning, development, and the goal(s) of
              development. In Vygotsky's usage, the term obuchenie, frequently
              translated as 'learning', more accurately indicates the
              interaction of teacher and student. Although the various domains
              (phylogenesis, sociocultural history, ontogenesis, and
              microgenesis) to which Vygotsky extended the concept of
              development have differing dynamics, the course of development
              within each domain is characterized by the transformative effects
              of cultural tools (mediational means) upon their users. Vygotsky

  abstract  = "Maimonides, in his Guide for the Perplexed,1 speaks of four
               forms of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest
               form is perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The
               great philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that
               the possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: ``A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.'' A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: ``he could [in any case] not be as strong as a
               mule.'' Moral perfection is the third, ``the highest degree of
               excellency in man's character.'' Of this perfection Maimonides
               says: ``Imagine a person being alone, and having no connection
               whatever with any other person; all his good moral principles
               are at rest, they are not required and give man no perfection
               whatever. These principles are only necessary and useful when
               man comes in contact with others.'' ``The fourth kind of
               perfection is the true perfection of man; the possession of the
               highest intellectual faculties . . . .'' In justification of his
               assertion, this extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges:
               ``Examine the first three kinds of perfection; you will find
               that if you possess them, they are not your property, but the
               property of others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is
               exclusively yours; no one else owns any part of it.''",

  abstract = "Purpose This paper aims to compare the performance of building
              trades apprenticeship programs in the USA, sponsored jointly by
              employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
              employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates, including
              participation of women and minorities. The article also looks
              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women
              and ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit
              markedly better performance for all groups on rates of attrition
              and completion. Joint programs have developed various
              innovations, including college credit for training and
              scholarship loans to expand apprenticeship and improve quality
              and retention, although there are no quantitative evaluations of
              the effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
              limitations/implications Statistical information includes about
              65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA. Practical
              implications The paper shows that alternative forms of training
              sponsorship have substantially different effects on enrolment and
              graduation. Identification of the practices, that improve
              enrolment and retention, and their widespread adoption would
              enhance the effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value
              The dataset used in this paper has not yet been used in any
              publications. The findings regarding joint programs are notable,
              in view of the skilled labor shortages facing the construction

              networks trained with a backpropagation algorithm by which
              complex mapping of factors to labor productivity is performed. To
              prevent networks from overfitting and improve their

              demonstrate the prediction performance of the presented models,
              the developed models are implemented at two real power plant

               with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are

               HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more
               deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions
               where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly
               related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new
               design approaches. However, few use this subjective, design-led
               method in their research. In this paper, I present a case study
               detailing my experience designing and deploying cultural probes
               in Bungoma, Kenya. Returns from my comment cards and digital
               camera activities draw attention to probe recipients' unique
               experiences and to Bungoma's distinctive characteristics; they
               also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. My
               experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a
               cultural probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by
               raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the
               pursuit of a single solution in design. More broadly, I offer a

               done 'for', 'with' or 'by' the users based on the assumption
               that users were real people. Today 'users' have become a
               component in mass-market production and are seen as 'customers',
               rather than people. Still designers need to address use, and
               personas have been introduced for this purpose. The paper uses
               research on user participation and research-based personas from
               the eGov+ project to discuss whether personas help designers
               engage with users. In this project, design was carried out in
               the domain of municipal services through involvement of clerks,
               management and citizens from three different municipalities.
               Through four cases we discuss if applying personas in
               participatory design settings is productive to designers'
               understanding of users' use situations. Does deployment of
               personas bring designers closer to the actual use situation? In
               which ways do personas help design for, with or by the users? Do

               Agency is understood as a multifaceted construct describing the
               idea that human beings make choices, act on these choices, and
               thereby exercise influence on their own lives as well as their
               environment. We argue that the concept is discussed from three
               different perspectives in the literature---transformational,
               dispositional, and relational---that are each related to
               learning and development in work contexts. These perspectives do
               not reflect incompatible positions but rather different aspects
               of the same phenomena. The chapter also offers an avenue of
               insight into empirical studies that employ agency as a central
               concept as well as discussions about concepts that closely

  title     = "Applying eye tracking in virtual construction environments to
               improve cognitive data collection and human-computer interaction

  abstract  = "In the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) field,
               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction
               industry. Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic
               mode and interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE
               device with Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the
               research gaps. Finally, an example experiment is provided to
               demonstrate studying hazard identification using eye tracking in
               construction safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from
               the participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan
               path and the 3D heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic
               construction site scenes. This paper provides an approach of
               applying eye tracking to gather more data in virtual environment
               for the future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to
               improve human-computer interaction using eye tracking in the

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design
              of an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two
              aspects of this work have subsequently been used for further
              research. Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its
              associated theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that
              it could be implemented in software. This interpretation has
              informed further research about how one can model context and its
              impact on learning, which has produced a design framework that
              has been successfully applied across a range of educational
              settings. Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The
              software has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
              supported explorations into how to scaffold learners'
              metacognition, how to scaffold learners' motivation and the
              implications of a learner's goal orientation upon their use of
              the software. The findings from these studies have informed our
              understanding of learner scaffolding and have produced consistent
              results to demonstrate the importance of providing learners with
              appropriately challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky's

              effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
              tutoring. ``No tutoring'' refers to instruction that teaches the
              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring
              systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or
              substep-based granularities of interaction, whereas most other
              tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have
              answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the
              granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases.
              In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of
              answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and
              adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0
              respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead,
              it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d
              = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems
              was 0.76, so they are nearly as effective as human tutoring.",

               Revolution) curriculum within secondary education. Across the
               UK, there is currently no systematic pedagogical design or
               evaluation to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning to
               include 4IR skills and knowledge. There is also no clear
               national strategy for schools and FE colleges to follow in how
               to embed 4IR, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and
               Internet of Things tools, skills and understanding into their
               teaching. Such a lack of an evidence-based research study
               impacts our young students in particular and education system in
               general, and further discriminates against disadvantaged and
               digitally excluded groups. We applied a design-based research
               methodology framework and worked with two London based schools
               to co-design and deliver a series of workshops to 13-14-year-old
               students introducing them to 4IR skills through engaging
               practical activities. Within the pilot study we engaged with
               both co-designers and students to capture opinion,
               understanding, learning and enjoyment before, during and after
               the workshops. The significance of this paper is twofold; to
               identify lessons learnt in developing 4IR skills and knowledge
               within the curriculum and to share the insights of the adults
               and young learners throughout the project.",

               mobile MR (MMR) within construction education and improvement of
               the learners' experience. With new building information

               engineering and construction industry, innovative MMR
               pedagogical delivery methods should be explored to enhance this

               outlines qualitative results derived through thematic analysis

               involving a lecture and a hands-on workshop focussed on MMR-BIM
               delivered within postgraduate construction education. Seventy
               participants across the two lessons recruited from an Australian

               applied mobile mixed reality create an enhanced learning
               environment for students?' The results of the analysis suggest
               that using MMR-BIM can result in an enhanced learning
               environment that facilitates unique learning experiences,
               engagement and motivation. However, the study outcome suggests

               topic is the application of AI in e-learning (AIeL) to improve
               the effectiveness of teaching and learning in precision
               education. This study aims to systematically review publication
               patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals,
               countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a
               co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the
               invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal
               directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total
               of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in
               follow-up studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found
               that a majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and
               applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using
               AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning
               contexts. For field researchers, the visualized network diagram

                 their use in school-to-work programs. These simulations were

                 critiqued regarding common problems in using them (e.g.,
                 usability, learnability, content, and available teacher

               construction industry. The problem is both quantitative and
               qualitative. There is a shortage in supply as due to a decrease
               in the influx of new labor, and existing workers are less
               productive as they age. The problem will only get worse as more
               and more major public projects are being planned. Options for
               increasing the labor supply are somewhat limited, and thus
               efforts need to be made to adopt new technologies that can
               improve the productivity and efficiency of field work and their
               processes. This paper introduces seven innovation technologies
               that have the best potential to increase productivity and thus
               reduce the burden of labor shortage problems. These include 1)
               Substitution by use of robotics and automation, 2) development
               and applications of Innovative materials to reduce on site field
               work, 3) increase in productivity through the implementation of
               Information Technology, 4) improved productivity through the
               application of modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of
               rework and redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating
               labor skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site

  abstract  = "The construction industry is facing an unprecedented, nationwide
               shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the second largest
               employer in the country and according to a Construction Industry
               Institute study 75\% of contractors are experiencing labor
               shortages that are manifesting themselves as cost overruns
               and/or schedule delays. This crisis has been a long time coming
               and our current culture has not helped the problem. Young people
               who don't go to college are seen as ``failures,'' and fewer
               native-born Americans want to work with their hands, outdoors?at
               any wage. In fact a group of high school students surveyed about
               attractive careers listed construction 498th out of 500 possible
               occupations. Not only does construction have an image problem,
               but also the workforce composition of the future is largely
               minority and women, a challenge for an industry that is
               dominantly and traditionally white male. In order to face this
               labor shortage head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill
               ? Change or continue to accept increases in project cost and
               duration. In response to this challenge, several contractors and
               construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
               programs to recruit more individuals to the construction trades,
               including charter schools, community outreach and active
               participation in high school career guidance by apprenticeship
               programs. More construction companies are realizing that
               diversity practices add economic value to their customers. They
               are establishing mentoring programs for minority and women
               contractors and employing consulting firms to assist them in
               acquiring these new cultural competencies. Other firms are
               focusing their efforts on creating a working atmosphere that
               embraces a diverse workforce, complete with worker training on
               how to effectively deal with the changing workplace culture.
               What positive effects are these approaches having on the overall
               problem? Should these individual efforts to improve the image of
               construction and its thrust for diversity be aligned? This paper
               will attempt to highlight the successes that some programs have
               achieved and what new innovations they invoked in their
               endeavors. Additionally, it will address areas where the efforts

  abstract  = "The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest
               challenges facing the construction industry. The Construction
               Users Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their
               workforce availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82
               percent of the respondents reported experiencing work force
               shortages on their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the
               trend had worsened over the previous three years. One promising
               solution to relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to
               provide adequate and effective training. Many research efforts
               on construction worker training have been conducted in the past
               decade in order to address the need and benefits of construction
               craft training. However, a quantitative analysis of construction
               craft trainings benefits and costs from the perspective of
               worker, project and company has rarely been carried out.
               Providing quantifiable analysis regarding the benefits and costs
               of training can help to solve the debate existing in the
               industry regarding the value of craft labor training and improve
               the effectiveness of craft training programs. The research
               investigated existing major datasets relevant with construction
               craft training developed by previous research. Meanwhile, as
               part of this research, a craft director training survey was
               administrated to measure training benefits in productivity,
               turnover, absenteeism safety and rework, as well as information
               such as core training subjects and common barriers for training.
               The primary objective of the study is to qualify the outcomes
               and effectiveness of strategies for construction craft training.
               Four secondary objectives are completed to help achieve the
               primary goal: (I) Identify the major characteristics of
               construction training and major factors affecting construction
               training; (II) Quantitatively measure the outcomes of
               construction training on the individual and project/company
               level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio models based on the
               survey administrated by the study as well as existing industry
               data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity analysis to identify
               real multiskilling patterns among craft workers in order to
               adopt multiskilling training strategies in the construction
               industry.",

                 housing costs are considered. The wage gap between older and
                 younger workers has widened since the 2008 financial crisis
                 and shows no signs of closing. The outlook is uncertain, with

               experienced by British unions since 1979. During that period,
               union membership has declined over 20 percent and three
               successive Conservative governments have enacted labor
               legislation opposed by unions. The author views the government's
               strongly unfavorable treatment of unions as a powerful force,

               growth of temporary and part-time workers and the decline of the
               manufacturing sector, are likely to have more lasting adverse
               effects. Unions are adopting various strategies to try to
               counteract the decline of their membership, including innovative
               organizing methods and expanded services for members. The fate
               of the unions will depend, the author concludes, on the success
               of those strategies, changes in the British economy, and the

               challenges lately in the context of geostrategic forces that are
               shaping our world. Recent technological changes, combined with
               shifts in global economic power, accelerating urbanization, and
               demographic changes have put pressure on the VET to become more
               responsive to the needs of the labour market and society.
               E-learning has been seen as an effective way of improving the
               quality of teaching and learning in VET schools due to its
               various forms. Nevertheless, there has been some disagreement in
               the litearture on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
               of e-learning in VET. Besides, some studies recently reported a
               decline in enthusiasm about the effects of e-learning in
               companies. In order to closely examine the effects of e-learning

               discussion of the pros and cons with the aim of developing
               suggestions for the better use of e-learning in VET. The results
               of the litearture review show that learners and providers of
               e-learning benefit from it in different ways. In order to
               minimise the risks involved in using e-learning, a mixture of

  abstract  = "AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced
               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and
               the extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
               system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
               Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
               secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
               that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks
               the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open
               the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet
               changing workforce needs in a changing industry.",

               (ITSs) would be to engage the students in sustained reasoning
               activity and to interact with the student based on a deep
               understanding of the students' behavior. This chapter begins by
               providing an overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The
               chapter comments on competing research goals in the field,
               followed by descriptions of two successful systems: (1) the
               Pittsburgh urban math project algebra tutor project and (2) the
               SHERLOCK project. These two systems are being deployed in
               real-world educational environments with substantial success.
               This chapter briefly describes the underlying theory and
               implementation of each system, to motivate later discussions. A
               description of the standard components in an intelligent
               tutoring system is also presented along with a discussion of
               human-computer interaction assessment issues unique to
               educational software. This chapter also provides a prescription
               for ITS design and development methods. Several issues
               concerning ITS design principles are also addressed in the
               chapter.",

  abstract = "Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves
              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
              high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA).
              To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that
              demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant
              support and was more effective at improving student learning than
              parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve
              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of
              the support.",

              ideal model, in a process calledknowledge tracing. The tutor
              presents an individualized sequence of exercises to the student
              based on these probability estimates until the student has
              `mastered' each rule. The programming tutor, cognitive model and

              teaching online during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis
              of survey and interview data show that teachers engaged regularly
              in emotional support of students, and a pedagogy of care was
              discernible in the ways teachers described seeking out signals
              that the students' needs were being met online. However,
              technology mediated communication made this more difficult in
              online teaching than face-to-face, increasing teachers' emotional
              labour. Teachers' efforts to achieve interaction with, and
              feedback from, students to inform their teaching approach,

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the
               level and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In
               this study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters' spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
               develop further solutions that encourage further improvement of
               teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.",

  abstract  = "This paper compares narrow, or specialised, and broad, or less
               specialised, upper-secondary vocational education (VE)
               programmes in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates'
               position in the labour market. The data are from three cohorts
               of the Dutch VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months
               after graduation. The programmes of the highest level---Level
               4---of the school-based learning route are investigated. To
               separate narrow from broad programmes, a novel criterion is
               used, based on the argument that the match between education and
               a job within a narrow programme's occupational domain is better
               than outside that domain and that, for a broad programme, such a
               match does not differ significantly between the programme's
               domain and outside it. This study shows that graduates from
               narrow education programmes have a less favourable labour market
               position than graduates from broad programmes. They have a
               greater chance of being unemployed and are more often mismatched
               in their jobs, both horizontally and vertically. They earn less
               in any case, particularly if their job is outside their
               occupational domain or below their level. They consequently
               experience worse career opportunities and many are more
               dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this problem, it would be
               better to focus on realising a shift in the influx of students
               from narrow to broad education programmes instead of broadening
               all narrow programmes. Besides this shift to broader programmes,
               offering broad variants of narrow programmes while maintaining
               the narrow, specialist variants could be highly allocation
               efficient.",

               policy reforms",
  author    = "Gambin, Lynn and Hogarth, Terence",
  abstract  = "That so many employers in various sectors continue to train
               apprentices despite incurring substantial costs can be taken as
               prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
               investment risk. The main downside in the English apprenticeship
               system is that the overall levels of employer engagement and
               training volumes are considered sub-optimal and in reality there
               is a fine balance which can put the performance of the firm and
               the wider economy at risk due to insufficient skill development.
               This paper draws on data from the Net Costs and Benefits of
               Training to Employers series of studies (carried out between
               1994 and 2012). Each of the original studies consisted of case
               studies of employers in particular sectors in which the costs
               associated with training an apprentice were considered against
               the benefits employers obtain through this activity during the
               training period. Data in the original studies was collected in
               face-to-face interviews with the employers. The data were
               aligned with an accounting framework that captured the relevant
               costs and benefits of apprenticeship training from the
               perspective of the employer. Calculations were carried out to
               also indicate the payback period (i.e. the period after training
               has taken over which an employer could be expected to recoup any
               net cost they had incurred). We present the most comprehensive
               available estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to
               employers in England to illustrate how costs vary across sectors
               and how, for most employers, engaging in apprenticeship training
               leaves them with a net cost at the end of the training period.
               The extent of this net cost at the end of the formal training
               period is found to vary substantially by sector and level of
               apprenticeship and over time, in real terms, the net costs of
               training have tended to increase across all sectors. Employers
               reported a range of rationales for training apprentices; from
               supply-led (e.g. where participation was prompted by training
               providers offering it for free) to more demand-led (e.g. where
               employers saw apprenticeship as necessary for acquiring needed
               skills) reasons. Employer sensitivity to various cost parameters
               depended upon where on the supply- to demand-led continuum they
               fell. Despite various policy changes since the mid-1990s,
               employers' engagement in apprenticeships in England has not
               achieved a significant volume and there are still financial
               risks attached to investing in this form of training. Even with
               the latest reforms of funding and delivery embodied in the move
               to apprenticeship standards and the introduction of an employer
               levy, there is no guarantee that more employers will be willing
               to train apprentices or that those who already engage will train
               more. There is a need to consider various ways of reducing
               employers' risk without inducing unintended behavioural changes
               that counter overall policy objectives.",

               through which workplace learning more generally can be examined.
               Drawing on data from a 3-year study of the social and
               pedagogical relationships between apprentices and older workers
               in the English steel industry, the article proposes that,
               building on Engestr{\"o}m's work, an `expansive' as opposed to a
               `restrictive' approach to apprenticeship will not only deliver
               the broader goals being set for apprenticeship programmes around
               the world, but will also foster workplace learning. The article
               offers a critique of Lave and Wenger's novice to expert
               conceptualisation of apprenticeship and, using data from
               employee learning logs, argues that pedagogical relationships

               characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical and
               pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be adequate to
               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life.
               The article concludes by arguing for a definition of vocational
               education and training which is a compound of the four general

              lining with a square base area of 80 $\times$ 80 cm and 140 cm in
              height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers,
              studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating
              were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55
              BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated
              archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the third
              well from the Early Neolithic period that has been discovered in
              the Czech Republic within the last four years. The design
              consists of grooved corner posts with inserted planks. This type
              of construction reveals advanced technical know-how and, till
              now, is the only known type from this region and time period.
              Thanks to the combination of annually resolved and absolutely

              combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across
              both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for different
              levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction in the next
              30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions saving
              potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence
              interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full
              uptake of the hybrid construction system by 2050. Our analysis
              does not account for carbon sequestration potential in timber,
              which would make the savings much greater. Still, the overall
              savings represent a 1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas
              emissions generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
              non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of

  abstract    = "CONTEXT: Evidence suggests that clinicians may not be learning
                 effectively from all facets of their practice, potentially
                 because their training has not fully prepared them to do so.
                 To address this gap, we argue that there is a need to identify
                 systems of instruction and assessment that enhance clinicians'
                 'preparation for future learning'. Preparation for future
                 learning (PFL) is understood to be the capacity to learn new
                 information, to use resources effectively and innovatively,
                 and to invent new strategies for learning and problem solving
                 in practice. CURRENT STATE: Education researchers have
                 developed study designs that use dynamic assessments to
                 measure what trainees have acquired in the past, as well as
                 what they are able to learn in the present. More recently,
                 researchers have also started to emphasise and measure whether
                 and how trainees take action to gain the information they need
                 to learn. Knowing that there are study designs and emerging
                 metrics for assessing PFL, the next question is how to design
                 instruction that helps trainees develop PFL capacities.
                 Although research evidence is still accumulating, the current
                 evidence base suggests training that encourages 'productive
                 failure' through guided discovery learning (i.e. where
                 trainees solve problems and perform tasks without direct
                 instruction, though often with some form of feedback) creates
                 challenging conditions that enhance learning and equip
                 trainees with PFL-related behaviours. CONCLUSIONS: Preparation
                 for future learning and the associated capacity of being
                 adaptive as one learns in and from training and clinical
                 practice have been missed in most contemporary training and
                 assessment systems. We propose a research agenda that (i)
                 explores how real-world adaptive expert activity unfolds in
                 the health care workplace to inform the design of instruction
                 for developing PFL, (ii) identifies measures of behaviours
                 that relate to PFL, and (iii) addresses potential
                 sociocultural barriers that limit clinicians' opportunities to
                 learn from their daily practice.",

               while creating paper based sketches motivated the development of

  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to study the effect of the
               gamification of virtual assembly planning on the user
               performance, user experience and
               engagement.Design/methodology/approach A multi-touch table was
               used to manipulate virtual parts and gamification features were
               integrated into the virtual assembly environment. An experiment
               was conducted in two conditions: a gamified and a non-gamified
               virtual environment. Subjects had to assemble a virtual pump.
               The user performance was evaluated in terms of the number of
               errors, the feasibility of the generated assembly sequence and
               the user feedback.Findings The gamification reduced the number
               of errors and increased the score representing the number of
               right decisions. The results of the subjective and objective
               analysis showed that the number of errors decreased with
               engagement in the gamified assembly. The increase in the overall
               user experience reduced the number of errors. The subjective
               evaluation showed a significant difference between the gamified

               engagement, the learning usability and the overall
               experience.Research limitations/implications The effective
               learning retention after training has not been tested, and
               longitudinal studies are necessary. The effect of the used
               gamification elements has been evaluated as a whole; further
               work could isolate the most beneficial features and add other
               elements that might be more beneficial for
               learning.Originality/value The research reported in this paper
               provides valuable insights into the gamification of virtual
               assembly using a low-cost multi-touch interface. The results are
               promising for training operators to assemble a product at the

               Steadily moving beyond a distinction between the physical and

               emerging practice-oriented approaches in HCI, this paper
               articulates a framework of materials experience that discusses

               led to the rapid adoption, sharing of 3D models on sites such as
               Thingiverse.com, and visions of a future in which customization
               is a norm and 3D printing can solve a variety of real-world
               problems. However, in practice, creating models is difficult and
               many end users simply print models created by others. In this
               paper, we explore a specific area of model design that is a
               challenge for end users' measurement. When a model must conform
               to a specific real world goal once printed, it is important that
               that goal is precisely specified. We demonstrate that
               measurement errors are a significant (yet often overlooked)
               challenge for end users through a systematic study of the
               sources and types of measurement errors. We argue for a new

               designers, as well as novice modelers, should to use at design
               time. We offer two strategies--buffer insertion and replacement
               of minimal parts--to help designers, as well as novice modelers,
               to build models that are robust to measurement error. We argue

               experiences are inaccessible to children with visual
               impairments. This paper presents a set of 3D-printable models
               designed as building blocks for creating movable tactile
               pictures that can be touched, moved, and understood by children
               with visual impairments. Examples of these models are canvases,
               connectors, hinges, spinners, sliders, lifts, walls, and
               cutouts. They can be used to compose movable tactile pictures to
               convey a range of spatial concepts, such as in/out, up/down, and
               high/low. The design and development of these models were
               informed by three formative studies including 1) a survey on
               popular moving mechanisms in children's books and 3D-printed
               parts to implement them, 2) two workshops on the process
               creating movable tactile pictures by hand (e.g., Lego,
               Play-Doh), and 3) creation of wood-based prototypes and an
               informal testing on sighted preschoolers. Also, we propose a
               design language based on XML and CSS for specifying the content
               and structure of a movable tactile picture. Given a
               specification, our system can generate a 3D-printable model. We
               evaluate our approach by 1) transcribing six children's books,
               and 2) conducting six interviews on domain experts including
               four teachers for the visually impaired, one blind adult, two

              dyslexic children and the other with children with cerebral
              palsy. An analysis of children's and researchers' power dynamics
              during design sessions supports us to understand the contextual
              factors shaping how the different participants exercised power;
              the outcomes of this power and to reflect on how these moments
              shaped the design agenda. Our work identifies a number of
              challenges and raises new questions that may guide future
              reflexive participatory practice with developmentally diverse
              children.",

  abstract = "Literacy is increasingly being thought of as a social practice
              with its use and understandings being context dependent. As an
              essential element within and of education, literacy offers
              possibilities for engaging in everyday life. Health literacy has
              emerged as a means to develop health-promoting practices that has
              meaning in social contexts. Reflecting biomedical interests, the
              focus of health literacy is predominately constructed as a
              neutral and technical process that has specific meaning and
              practice, positioning it as functional literacy. This paper
              presents one approach to critical health literacy based on a
              multidimension (3D) approach with literacy as a situated social
              practice. The 3D model will be described and then the model's
              application to health literacy will be explored. The use of the
              3D model to build critical health literacy challenges the
              biomedical approach to health literacy as solely functional
              literacy. Functional literacy is not sufficient for a person to
              build a critical social consciousness and illuminate how social
              determinates of health create inequitable health or how it could
              be ameliorated. Social justice and equity are presented as
              fundamental prerequisites for health. Working with young people
              in context of schools, the reciprocal relationship between health
              and education offers space for possibilities around literacy
              skills and understanding about what creates health. The same
              space can enable young people to see opportunities for
              empowerment to shape and recreate their social reality. Health
              literacy for social justice and equity, therefore, has to include
              possibilities for understanding and responding to sociocultural
              knowing.",

                 Hobart, TAS, Australia.",
  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Grounded theory is a well-known methodology
                 employed in many research studies. Qualitative and
                 quantitative data generation techniques can be used in a
                 grounded theory study. Grounded theory sets out to discover or
                 construct theory from data, systematically obtained and
                 analysed using comparative analysis. While grounded theory is
                 inherently flexible, it is a complex methodology. Thus, novice
                 researchers strive to understand the discourse and the
                 practical application of grounded theory concepts and
                 processes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this article is to provide a
                 contemporary research framework suitable to inform a grounded
                 theory study. RESULT: This article provides an overview of
                 grounded theory illustrated through a graphic representation
                 of the processes and methods employed in conducting research
                 using this methodology. The framework is presented as a
                 diagrammatic representation of a research design and acts as a
                 visual guide for the novice grounded theory researcher.
                 DISCUSSION: As grounded theory is not a linear process, the
                 framework illustrates the interplay between the essential
                 grounded theory methods and iterative and comparative actions
                 involved. Each of the essential methods and processes that
                 underpin grounded theory are defined in this article.
                 CONCLUSION: Rather than an engagement in philosophical
                 discussion or a debate of the different genres that can be
                 used in grounded theory, this article illustrates how a
                 framework for a research study design can be used to guide and
                 inform the novice nurse researcher undertaking a study using
                 grounded theory. Research findings and recommendations can
                 contribute to policy or knowledge development, service
                 provision and can reform thinking to initiate change in the
                 substantive area of inquiry.",

                 In addition to the general JARS-Qual guidelines, the Working
                 Group has developed standards for both qualitative
                 meta-analysis and mixed methods research. The reporting
                 standards were developed for psychological qualitative
                 research but may hold utility for a broad range of social
                 sciences. They honor a range of qualitative traditions,
                 methods, and reporting styles. The Working Group was composed
                 of a group of researchers with backgrounds in varying methods,
                 research topics, and approaches to inquiry. In this article,
                 they present these standards and their rationale, and they
                 detail the ways that the standards differ from the
                 quantitative research reporting standards. They describe how
                 the standards can be used by authors in the process of writing
                 qualitative research for submission as well as by reviewers
                 and editors in the process of reviewing research. (PsycINFO

               disasters seem to be hitting at a breakneck pace. In 2022, the
               world experienced record heat waves in China and Europe, and
               devastating floods in Pakistan killed over 1,000 people and
               displaced millions. But a close look at energy and emissions
               data around the world shows that there are a few bright spots of
               good news, and a lot of potential progress ahead. For example,
               renewable sources make up a growing fraction of the energy
               supply, and they're getting cheaper every year. Countries are
               setting new targets for emissions reductions, and unprecedented
               public investments could unlock more technological advances.

               between 1300 and 1500, it had less to do with language and more
               with a fundamental shift in the making of things themselves. The
               relationship between drawing and design did not give rise to a

               as it had previously been used, and in a way that may now be
               important to reverse. The Latin root of ``design,'' designo,
               conveyed to the likes of Cicero a far wider, more abstract set
               of meanings than many generally give the word today. These

               tactical (to contrive and achieve a goal) to the organizational

               experiences. Without a clear understanding of the human side of
               virtual reality (VR), the experience will always fail. The VR
               Book bridges this gap by focusing on human-centered design.
               Creating compelling VR applications is an incredibly complex
               challenge. When done well, these experiences can be brilliant
               and pleasurable, but when done badly, they can result in
               frustration and sickness. Whereas limitations of technology can
               cause bad VR execution, problems are oftentimes caused by a lack
               of understanding human perception, interaction, design
               principles, and real users. This book focuses on the human
               elements of VR, such as how users perceive and intuitively
               interact with various forms of reality, causes of VR sickness,
               creating useful and pleasing content, and how to design and
               iterate upon effective VR applications. This book is not just
               for VR designers, it is for managers, programmers, artists,
               psychologists, engineers, students, educators, and user
               experience professionals. It is for the entire VR team, as
               everyone contributing should understand at least the basics of
               the many aspects of VR design. The industry is rapidly evolving,
               and The VR Book stresses the importance of building prototypes,
               gathering feedback, and using adjustable processes to

              immersive VR simulations in science classrooms introduces new
              challenges, whilst there is a lack of learning designs to inform
              practice. As part of this study, we firstly present a learning
              experience (LX) design seeking to introduce an immersive VR
              simulation in Physics classrooms to support high-school students'
              understanding of the Special Theory of Relativity. Then, we
              present an empirical investigation on the enactment and
              evaluation of the proposed LX design, with 109 high-school
              students (10--11th graders). A mixed-method approach was adopted
              to evaluate students' conceptual learning gains along with their
              perceptions of the learning experience, encompassing the
              immersive VR simulation and the inquiry-based learning process
              adopted. We reflect on our LX design aimed at the integration of
              an immersive VR simulation in an inquiry-based learning
              environment and we highlight questions for further research.",

                 into using 360° videos to present small segments of lecture
                 content for IT students in an Australian University. The aim
                 of this study was to understand; what is the impact of
                 incorporating 360° videos into class content for students and
                 teaching staff? In this study the 360° videos are described as
                 ``learning atoms''. Learning atoms are short duration videos
                 (1 to 5 minutes) captured in 360°. Background: Within this
                 paper we conducted experiments in the classroom using 360°
                 videos to determine if they have an impact on student's
                 feeling of presence with class content. Additionally, to
                 follow up, how does the inclusion of 360° impact on the
                 teaching experience. Methodology: The methodology used in this
                 study focused on both quantitative and qualita-tive aspects.
                 Data was captured at the same time during the teaching period
                 to address the research questions. In order to gauge the
                 feeling of presence within the classroom a short survey was
                 administered to students in the undergraduate IT class at the
                 start (pre) and end (post) of the semester using the same
                 questions to measure any change. Contribution: The main
                 contributions from this study were that we demonstrated there
                 is a potential for providing an alternative `immersive'
                 content presentation for students. This alternative content
                 took the form of 360° learning atoms, whereas further showed
                 our nuance process for creating and publishing of these atoms.
                 Findings: The results show that for students, learning atoms
                 can help improve the sense of presence, particularly for
                 remote students, however the interactive experience can take
                 student's attention away from the lecturer. The results
                 present potential for providing an alternative `immersive'
                 content presentation for students, however problems for uptake
                 are present for both students and teachers, such as image
                 capture quality and file size Impact on Society: We foresee
                 this approach as being a new approach to teaching students in
                 higher education within online spaces to increase engagement
                 and move towards having a richer virtual experience no matter
                 the location. Future Research: Future research will be
                 conducted to resolve whether presence and engagement is
                 supported by the inclusion of 360° videos in the classroom.",

              However, little is known about this new generation of mobile

              The proposed framework aims to explain the drivers of attitudinal
              and intentional reactions, such as continuance in gaming or
              willingness to invest money in in-app purchases. A survey among

              Virtual Reality for Education and Training Purpose",
  author   = "Mastli, Majid and Zhang, Jiansong",
  abstract = "In a construction project, cranes are usually involved in the
              mobilization of materials and equipment. Therefore, a
              well-planned crane movement on a construction job site increases
              the efficiency of construction operations. This is especially the
              case when a crane is being operated from the material storage
              place to the workspace in a highway construction project, because
              the time allowed for such movement is typically tight, as
              constrained by the vehicular traffic on the highway. To explore
              the use of construction simulation in facilitating people?s
              understanding of construction processes, this paper presents a
              crane movement simulation from the site storage location to the
              beam erection location in a highway construction project on the
              Interstate 94. This simulation was modeled in the Unity 3D game
              engine and visualized in a CAVE virtual reality environment. CAVE
              is an immersive virtual reality environment where projections
              according to different view angles of a scene are projected onto
              different walls of a space. The purpose of this simulation is to
              help people plan crane routes during the construction planning
              phase. The objectives of planning the crane routes are minimizing
              crane trip length and trip time so as to minimize interruptions
              to the highway traffic, save construction costs, and achieve more
              sustainable construction operations. The simulation was tried by
              72 volunteers. A survey of these volunteers showed that 95\% of
              them understood crane operations after trying the simulation,
              compared to 35\% before trying the simulation, and 80\% of the
              responses agreed that such simulation helps people conduct
              construction planning.",

               In this paper, we test the efficacy of natural language tutoring
               to teach and scaffold acquisition of these skills. We describe
               ProPL (Pro-PELL), a dialogue-based intelligent tutoring system
               that elicits goal decompositions and program plans from students
               in natural language. The system uses a variety of tutoring
               tactics that leverage students' intuitive understandings of the
               problem, how it might be solved, and the underlying concepts of
               programming. We report the results of a small-scale evaluation
               comparing students who used ProPL with a control group who read
               the same content. Our primary findings are that students who
               received tutoring from ProPL seem to have developed an improved
               ability to solve the composition problem and displayed behaviors
               that suggest they were able to think at greater levels of

  abstract  = "Purpose Apprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
               published research on apprenticeship training that is
               specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
               the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approach A systematic review
               approach was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using
               SCOPUS databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified
               and analysed.Findings It was found that monitoring and control
               is the most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth
               of studies that has focused on apprentices training in
               developing countries.Research limitations/implications The gaps
               identified in the current knowledge on apprenticeship training
               would serve as a justification for future investigations.
               However, the scope of the review is limited to papers published
               in academic journals and citable through SCOPUS.Practical
               implications The outcomes of the study provide researchers and
               other relevant stakeholders with a concise report on the
               findings of previous studies. It also provides insight into
               strategies for improving the completion rates of apprenticeship
               training in the construction sector.Originality/value A
               systematic evaluation of the extant literature draws on
               theoretical evidence and highlights the factors that are more
               likely to influence the outcomes of apprentice training for
               craftspeople in the construction sector.",

  abstract  = "It is only in the last century, and only in industrialized
               nations, that formal schooling has emerged as a widespread
               method of educating the young. Before schools, apprenticeship
               was the most common means of learning, used to transmit the
               knowledge required for expert practice in fields from painting
               and sculpting to medicine and law. Even today, many complex and
               important skills, such as those required for language use and
               social interaction, are learned informally through
               apprenticeshiplike methods--i.e., methods involving not didactic
               teaching, but observation, coaching, and successive
               approximation while carrying out a variety of tasks and
               activities. The differences between formal schooling and
               apprenticeship methods are many, but for our purposes, one is
               most important. Perhaps as a by-product of the specialization of
               learning in schools, skills and knowledge taught in schools have
               become abstracted from their uses in the world. In
               apprenticeship learning, on the other hand, target skills are
               not only continually in use by skilled practitioners, but are
               instrumental to the accomplishment of meaningful tasks. Said
               differently, apprenticeship embeds the learning of skills and
               knowledge in the social and functional context of their use.
               This difference is not academic, but has serious implications
               for the nature of the knowledge that students acquire. This
               paper attempts to elucidate some of those implications through a
               proposal for the retooling of apprenticeship methods for the
               teaching and learning of cognitive skills. Specifically, we
               propose the development of a new cognitive apprenticeship to
               teach students the thinking and problem-solving skills involved
               in school subjects such as reading, writing, and mathematics.
               The organization of the paper is as follows: In the first
               section, we discuss briefly what we believe to be key
               shortcomings in current curricular and pedagogical practices. We
               then present some of the structural features of traditional
               apprenticeship and discuss, in general, what would be required
               to adapt these characteristics to the teaching and learning of
               cognitive skills. In the second section we consider in detail
               three recently developed pedagogical ``success models,'' which
               we believe exemplify aspects of apprenticeship methods in
               teaching the thinking and reasoning skills involved in reading,
               writing and mathematics. We attempt to show how and why these
               methods are successful with regard to the development of not
               only the cognitive, but also the metacognitive, skills requited
               for true expertise. In the final section, we organize our ideas
               on the purposes and characteristics of successful teaching into
               a general framework for the design of learning environments,
               where ``environment'' includes the content being taught, the
               pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning
               activities, and the sociology of learning. This framework
               emphasizes how cognitive apprenticeship goes beyond the
               techniques of traditional apprenticeship. We hope it will be
               useful to the field in designing, evaluating, and doing research
               on pedagogical methods, materials, and technologies.",

  abstract  = "This article seeks to propose a rationale for exploratory
               research in the social sciences. Inspired by the recent debates
               around qualitative methods (Gerring, 2001; George and Bennett,
               2005; Brady and Collier, 2004; Mahoney and Rueschemeyer, 2003;
               Ragin, 2008; to name just a few), I seek to demonstrate that
               exploratory research also has a rightful place within the social
               sciences. In order to live up to its potential, exploratory
               research needs to be conducted in a transparent, honest, and
               selfreflexive way -- and follow a set of guidelines that ensure
               its reliability. Exploratory research, if conducted in such a
               way, can achieve great validity and it can provide new and
               innovative ways to analyze reality. In most cases, exploration
               demands more from the researcher than confirmatory research,
               both in terms of preparation, as well as in terms of willingness
               and ability to expose oneself to foreign cultures and languages
               as well as the courage to engage in a critical and honest
               selfreflection and critique. It also requires intellectual
               engagement with the topic at stake far beyond the needs of those
               running regressions from their office computers. However,
               exploratory research normally demands less money to conduct, as
               most projects can be done by one researcher alone, without the
               need to mobilize, train, and pay, large research apparatuses.
               Given the disciplinary power of elite scholars and academic
               institutions when it comes to selecting research through funding
               and hiring, exploratory research thus has great emancipatory
               potential, because it can escape the disciplinary power of
               senior ``peers'' and mainstream funding agencies. To legitimize
               and provide a solid epistemological ground for exploratory
               research in the social sciences, it needs to be grounded in a
               philosophy of science; it has to be articulated within an
               epistemological framework; and it has to formulate a
               comprehensive methodological framework that justifies its
               methods. Thought also needs to be given to the ontology of the
               social sciences, as decisions about what counts as real and what
               we shall accept as a fact necessarily impact our strategy of
               inquiry.",

  title    = "Applying {HRO} and resilience engineering to construction:
              Barriers and opportunities",
  author   = "Harvey, Eleanor J and Waterson, Patrick and Dainty, Andrew R J",
  abstract = "High reliability organising (HRO) and resilience engineering (RE)
              have emerged as key concepts in safety management which promise a
              move away from bureaucracy and a means to manage safety without
              sacrificing performance. However, attempts to apply these ideas
              outside the ultra-safe sectors within which they developed have
              so far been limited. This paper uses the construction industry as
              a test case to explore the applicability of HRO and RE in a less
              highly regulated context. Through this discussion the research
              gaps are highlighted which have prevented the expansion of these
              new approaches into new sectors. The project-based nature,
              transient workforce, widespread outsourcing of labour and
              financial pressure of the construction sector limit opportunities
              for investment in employees and learning from experience; hence,
              developing principles advocated by HRO and RE such as management
              commitment, sensitivity to the frontline, prioritisation of
              safety, empowerment of employees, and a just culture presents a
              significant challenge. In spite of these barriers, there are also
              opportunities to be considered for construction to incorporate
              aspects of HRO and RE at an employee-centred level rather than
              organisational: Aspects of mindfulness and imagination; RE's
              progressive understanding of accidents; and its holistic approach
              to cultivating resilience. It is argued that these opportunities
              offer a useful perspective for reframing safety debates in
              construction. The paper concludes with a research agenda which
              puts forward the need to extend and adapt aspects of HRO and RE
              in order to tackle some of the key characteristics of
              construction, namely subcontractor networks and temporary
              projects.",

  abstract    = "Maps are a mainstay of visual, somatosensory, and motor coding
                 in many species. However, auditory maps of space have not been
                 reported in the primate brain. Instead, recent studies have
                 suggested that sound location may be encoded via broadly
                 responsive neurons whose firing rates vary roughly
                 proportionately with sound azimuth. Within frontal space, maps
                 and such rate codes involve different response patterns at the
                 level of individual neurons. Maps consist of neurons
                 exhibiting circumscribed receptive fields, whereas rate codes
                 involve open-ended response patterns that peak in the
                 periphery. This coding format discrepancy therefore poses a
                 potential problem for brain regions responsible for
                 representing both visual and auditory information. Here, we
                 investigated the coding of auditory space in the primate
                 superior colliculus(SC), a structure known to contain visual
                 and oculomotor maps for guiding saccades. We report that, for
                 visual stimuli, neurons showed circumscribed receptive fields
                 consistent with a map, but for auditory stimuli, they had
                 open-ended response patterns consistent with a rate or
                 level-of-activity code for location. The discrepant response
                 patterns were not segregated into different neural populations
                 but occurred in the same neurons. We show that a read-out
                 algorithm in which the site and level of SC activity both
                 contribute to the computation of stimulus location is
                 successful at evaluating the discrepant visual and auditory
                 codes, and can account for subtle but systematic differences
                 in the accuracy of auditory compared to visual saccades. This
                 suggests that a given population of neurons can use different
                 codes to support appropriate multimodal behavior.",

  abstract    = "Rivalry is a common tool to probe visual awareness: a constant
                 physical stimulus evokes multiple, distinct perceptual
                 interpretations (``percepts'') that alternate over time.
                 Percepts are typically described as mutually exclusive,
                 suggesting that a discrete (all-or-none) process underlies
                 changes in visual awareness. Here we follow two strategies to
                 address whether rivalry is an all-or-none process: first, we
                 introduce two reflexes as objective measures of rivalry, pupil
                 dilation and optokinetic nystagmus (OKN); second, we use a
                 continuous input device (analog joystick) to allow observers a
                 gradual subjective report. We find that the ``reflexes''
                 reflect the percept rather than the physical stimulus. Both
                 reflexes show a gradual dependence on the time relative to
                 perceptual transitions. Similarly, observers' joystick
                 deflections, which are highly correlated with the reflex
                 measures, indicate gradual transitions. Physically simulating
                 wave-like transitions between percepts suggest piece-meal
                 rivalry (i.e., different regions of space belonging to
                 distinct percepts) as one possible explanation for the gradual
                 transitions. Furthermore, the reflexes show that dominance
                 durations depend on whether or not the percept is actively
                 reported. In addition, reflexes respond to transitions with
                 shorter latencies than the subjective report and show an
                 abundance of short dominance durations. This failure to report
                 fast changes in dominance may result from limited access of
                 introspection to rivalry dynamics. In sum, reflexes reveal
                 that rivalry is a gradual process, rivalry's dynamics is
                 modulated by the required action (response mode), and that
                 rapid transitions in perceptual dominance can slip away from
                 awareness.",

              describes expertise development as the progression through a
              series of consecutive phases, each of which is characterized by
              functionally different knowledge structures underlying
              performance. The first phase is characterized by the accumulation
              of causal knowledge about disease and its consequences. Through
              experience with real cases, this knowledge transforms into
              narrative structures called illness scripts. The cognitive
              mechanisms responsible for this transition are: Encapsulation of
              elaborated knowledge into high level but simplified causal models
              or even diagnostic categories and tuning through the inclusion of
              contextual information. The third phase is characterized by the
              use of episodic memories of actual patients in the diagnosis of
              new cases. It is assumed that knowledge acquired in different
              phases form layers in memory through a sedimentation process.
              These knowledge sediments, although usually not applied any more
              in subsequent phases in the development of expertise, remain
              available for use when ontologically more recently acquired

               tailored to the research questions that guide an investigation.
               The paper questions how far this position pertains to actual
               research practice. Drawing on interviews with researchers about
               their practices in relation to mixed?method research, two
               discourses were found in the transcripts. A particularistic
               discourse that reflects the traditional view, whereby
               mixed?method research is viewed as only appropriate when
               research questions warrant it, was uncovered. In addition, a
               universalistic discourse, which sees mixed?method research as
               more generally superior, was also uncovered. The implications of
               these viewpoints for understanding the role of research
               questions are then discussed.",

  title       = "Grounded cognition: past, present, and future",
  author      = "Barsalou, Lawrence W",
  affiliation = "Department of Psychology, Emory University.",
  abstract    = "Thirty years ago, grounded cognition had roots in philosophy,
                 perception, cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics,
                 cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuropsychology. During
                 the next 20 years, grounded cognition continued developing in
                 these areas, and it also took new forms in robotics, cognitive
                 ecology, cognitive neuroscience, and developmental psychology.
                 In the past 10 years, research on grounded cognition has grown
                 rapidly, especially in cognitive neuroscience, social
                 neuroscience, cognitive psychology, social psychology, and
                 developmental psychology. Currently, grounded cognition
                 appears to be achieving increased acceptance throughout
                 cognitive science, shifting from relatively minor status to
                 increasing importance. Nevertheless, researchers wonder
                 whether grounded mechanisms lie at the heart of the cognitive
                 system or are peripheral to classic symbolic mechanisms.
                 Although grounded cognition is currently dominated by
                 demonstration experiments in the absence of well-developed
                 theories, the area is likely to become increasingly theory
                 driven over the next 30 years. Another likely development is
                 the increased incorporation of grounding mechanisms into
                 cognitive architectures and into accounts of classic cognitive
                 phenomena. As this incorporation occurs, much functionality of
                 these architectures and phenomena is likely to remain, along
                 with many original mechanisms. Future theories of grounded
                 cognition are likely to be heavily influenced by both
                 cognitive neuroscience and social neuroscience, and also by
                 developmental science and robotics. Aspects from the three
                 major perspectives in cognitive science-classic symbolic
                 architectures, statistical/dynamical systems, and grounded
                 cognition-will probably be integrated increasingly in future
                 theories, each capturing indispensable aspects of

  abstract    = "Many studies deal with solution strategies in mental-rotation
                 tests. The approaches range from global analysis, attention to
                 object parts, holistic and piecemeal strategy to a combined
                 strategy. Other studies do not speak of strategies, but of
                 holistic or piecemeal processes or even of holistic or
                 piecemeal rotation. The methodological approach used here is
                 to identify mental-rotation strategies via gaze patterns
                 derived from eye-tracking data when solving chronometric
                 mental-rotation tasks with gender-stereotyped objects. The
                 mental-rotation test consists of 3 male-stereotyped objects
                 (locomotive, hammer, wrench) and 3 femalestereotyped objects
                 (pram, hand mirror, brush) rotated at eight different angles.
                 The sample consisted of 16 women and 10 men (age: M=21.58;
                 SD=4.21). The results of a qualitative analysis with two
                 individual objects (wrench and brush) showed four different

                 frequency in the two objects and correlated differently with

                 objectoriented or an egocentric mental-rotation strategy

                 approach has been developed to identify mental-rotation

               by mapping situations to actions so as to maximize cumulative
               rewards. In recent years RL has achieved great success in
               inducing effective pedagogical policies for various interactive
               e-learning environments. However, it is often prohibitive to
               identify the critical pedagogical decisions that actually
               contribute to desirable learning outcomes. In this work, by
               utilizing the RL framework we defined critical decisions to be
               those states in which the agent has to take the optimal actions,
               and subsequently, the Critical policy as carrying out optimal
               actions in the critical states while acting randomly in others.
               We proposed a general Critical-RL framework for identifying
               critical decisions and inducing a Critical policy. The
               effectiveness of our Critical-RL framework is empirically
               evaluated from two perspectives: whether optimal actions must be
               carried out in critical states (the necessary hypothesis) and
               whether only carrying out optimal actions in critical states is
               as effective as a fully-executed RL policy (the sufficient
               hypothesis). Our results confirmed both hypotheses.",

  author    = "Wang, Juanru and Yang, Jin",
  abstract  = "This paper is to investigate how employees' tacit knowledge
               sharing behavior is influenced by various antecedents. We
               propose that tacit knowledge sharing consists of three specific
               behaviors (i.e., socialization, externalization, and
               internalization) and they are influenced by four antecedents
               (trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and IT support). A
               survey was conducted to collect data from 258 knowledge workers
               who worked on complex product development projects. Structural
               equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results
               demonstrate that trust, self-efficacy, knowledge tacitness, and
               IT support significantly affect the externalization and
               internalization behaviors, and trust and IT support
               significantly affect the socialization behavior. This study is
               helpful to organizations where it is critical for employees to
               share tacit knowledge. It suggests that tacit knowledge is
               difficult to share and organizations should nurture mutual trust
               between employees, enhance their self-efficacy, and provide
               sufficient IT support so that they are more likely to engage in
               tacit knowledge sharing.",

              task-based training where the user can interact with a working

              the virtual environment similar to tasks a worker would have to

              be a method of rapidly training younger miners while
              supplementing on-the-job training practices and ultimately reduce
              accidents. The model was developed using CAD software and then

               predicted different aspects of navigation performance. Users who

               the route from memory. In contrast, consistent interaction
               switching (i.e. perspective transformation) during study
               predicted navigational efficiency when participants were
               unexpectedly tasked to return to the origin of the route.
               Individual differences also related to aspects of user

  abstract  = "Knowledge is a complex concept, yet the dominant view of
               knowledge in the management literature is a dichotomy between
               tacit and explicit. Even the knowledge management literature
               tends to view knowledge on a limited number of dimensions,
               whether this is in discussions of knowledge as a commodity or
               the process of knowing. A review of knowledge from first
               principles shows that knowledge has different degrees of
               validity, is highly heterogeneous and has complicated temporal
               and social aspects. A model of knowledge based on these aspects
               is presented. Comparing the four dimensions of knowledge with
               knowledge as a process opens up a more holistic view of
               knowledge management and helps articulate some of the key
               differences within streams of research in the field. This
               holistic perspective is also compatible with Polanyi's original
               complex conception of tacit knowledge, which drew heavily on
               Gestalt theory, a theory that examines the perception of
               ``wholes''. The dual perspectives of a multi-dimensional
               conception of knowledge as a commodity and a holistic
               perspective on knowledge management expands the avenues of
               potential research and improves our ability to put knowledge in

  abstract  = "Polanyi's tacit knowledge captures the idea ``we can know more
               than we can tell.'' Many researchers in the knowledge management
               community have used the idea of tacit knowledge to draw a
               distinction between that which cannot be formally represented
               (tacit knowledge) and knowledge which can be so represented
               (explicit knowledge). I argue that the deference that knowledge
               management researchers give to tacit knowledge hinders
               potentially fruitful work for two important reasons. First, the
               inability to explicate knowledge does not imply that the
               knowledge cannot be formally represented. Second, assuming the
               inability to formalize tacit knowledge as it exists in the minds
               of people does not exclude the possibility that computer systems
               might perform the same tasks using alternative representations.
               By reviewing work from artificial intelligence, I will argue
               that a richer model of cognition and knowledge representation is
               needed to study and build knowledge management systems.",

                 of direction in the development of training tools in medical
                 education. We carried out a panel discussion at the Center for

                 Unreasonable Patient Demand for Antibiotics--A Study of
                 Medical Ethics Using Immersive Virtual Reality'' (1). METHODS:
                 In Pan et al.'s study, 21 general practitioners (GPs) and GP
                 trainees took part in a videoed, 15-min virtual reality
                 scenario involving unnecessary patient demands for
                 antibiotics. This paper was discussed in-depth at the Center
                 for Behavior Change 3rd Annual Conference; the content of this
                 paper is a culmination of findings and feedback from the panel

                 reality, general practice, medicines management, medical
                 education and training, ethics, and philosophy. VIEWPOINT:
                 Virtual reality is an unexplored methodology to instigate
                 positive behavioral change among clinicians where other
                 methods have been unsuccessful, such as antimicrobial
                 stewardship. There are several arguments in favor of use of
                 virtual reality in medical education: it can be used for
                 ``difficult to simulate'' scenarios and to standardize a
                 scenario, for example, for use in exams. However, there are
                 limitations to its usefulness because of the cost implications
                 and the lack of evidence that it results in demonstrable
                 behavior change.",

               machine learning assistants (MLAs) that help workers, and help
               train them, to sort objects efficiently by providing automated
               perceptual guidance. In a randomized experiment (n = 140), we
               found: (1) A low-accuracy MLA is worse than no MLA at all, both
               in terms of task performance and learning. (2) A perfect MLA led
               to the best task performance, but was no better in helping users
               to learn than having no MLA at all. (3) Users tend to follow the
               MLA's judgments too often, even when they were incorrect.
               Finally, (4) we devised a novel learning analytics algorithm to
               assess the worker's accuracy, with the goal of obtaining
               additional training labels that can be used for fine-tuning the

                 and Miller. First, each model is explored in detail in the
                 following aspects: (a) history and development, (b)
                 description of the model (including the model figures), (c)
                 empirical support, and (d) instruments constructed based on
                 the model. Then, the models are compared in a number of
                 aspects: (a) citations, (b) phases and subprocesses, (c) how
                 they conceptualize (meta)cognition, motivation and emotion,
                 (d) top-down/bottom-up, (e) automaticity, and (f) context. In
                 the discussion, the empirical evidence from the existing SRL
                 meta-analyses is examined and implications for education are
                 extracted. Further, four future lines of research are
                 proposed. The review reaches two main conclusions. First, the
                 SRL models form an integrative and coherent framework from
                 which to conduct research and on which students can be taught
                 to be more strategic and successful. Second, based on the
                 available meta-analytic evidence, there are differential
                 effects of SRL models in light of differences in students'
                 developmental stages or educational levels. Thus, scholars and
                 teachers need to start applying these differential effects of
                 the SRL models and theories to enhance students' learning and
                 SRL skills.",

  abstract    = "Abstract Background Internships are highly relevant learning
                 experiences for engineering students. However, such
                 practice-based learning settings must be carefully designed to
                 allow their learning potential to unfold. Purpose Exploring
                 the job demands-control-support (JDCS) model, this study aimed
                 to investigate how job demands, job control, and social
                 support affect interns' use of different learning strategies.
                 Method The study utilized data collected from a sample of
                 engineering students (n =?118) who completed a required
                 internship during their degree. The data were analyzed using a
                 structural equation modeling approach including latent
                 factors. Results Job demands were found to be a relevant and
                 significant driver of students' shared regulation (e.g.,
                 asking for feedback), self-regulation (e.g., self-directed use
                 of codified information), efforts to relate theory to practice
                 (e.g., connecting workplace experience with theoretical
                 knowledge), and the absence of avoidance of learning (e.g.,
                 lack of adaptation to work situations), but not of external
                 regulation (e.g., asking for help to solve problems). Job
                 control, however, was not found to be a positive or
                 significant driver of student learning. Social support was
                 found to be a relevant and significant predictor of external
                 and shared regulation but not of the other learning
                 activities. Conclusions This study provided mixed findings
                 regarding key hypotheses central to the JDCS model, generating
                 rather poor evidence supporting it. In fact, job demands, job
                 control, and social support exhibited much less explanatory
                 power than expected for engineering students' learning during
                 internships.",

  abstract = "Argues that the main point of disagreement in the debate over the
              nature of mental imagery concerns the following: (a) whether
              certain aspects of the way in which images are transformed should
              be attributed to intrinsic knowledge-independent properties of
              the medium in which images are instantiated or the mechanisms by
              which they are processed; or (b) whether images are typically
              transformed in certain ways because Ss take their task to be the
              simulation of the act of witnessing certain real events taking
              place and therefore use their tacit knowledge of the imaged
              situation to cause the transformation to proceed as they believe
              it would have proceeded in reality. The tacit knowledge account
              is seen as more plausible because empirical results demonstrate
              that both ``mental scanning'' and ``mental rotation''
              transformations can be critically influenced by varying the
              instructions given to Ss and the precise form of the task used
              and, that the form of the influence is explainable in terms of
              the semantic content of Ss' beliefs and goals. (40 ref) (PsycINFO

  abstract    = "Although the study of visual perception has made more progress
                 in the past 40 years than any other area of cognitive science,
                 there remain major disagreements as to how closely vision is
                 tied to cognition. This target article sets out some of the
                 arguments for both sides (arguments from computer vision,
                 neuroscience, psychophysics, perceptual learning, and other
                 areas of vision science) and defends the position that an
                 important part of visual perception, corresponding to what
                 some people have called early vision, is prohibited from
                 accessing relevant expectations, knowledge, and utilities in
                 determining the function it computes--in other words, it is
                 cognitively impenetrable. That part of vision is complex and
                 involves top-down interactions that are internal to the early
                 vision system. Its function is to provide a structured
                 representation of the 3-D surfaces of objects sufficient to
                 serve as an index into memory, with somewhat different outputs
                 being made available to other systems such as those dealing
                 with motor control. The paper also addresses certain
                 conceptual and methodological issues raised by this claim,
                 such as whether signal detection theory and event-related
                 potentials can be used to assess cognitive penetration of
                 vision. A distinction is made among several stages in visual
                 processing, including, in addition to the inflexible
                 early-vision stage, a pre-perceptual attention-allocation
                 stage and a post-perceptual evaluation, selection, and
                 inference stage, which accesses long-term memory. These two
                 stages provide the primary ways in which cognition can affect
                 the outcome of visual perception. The paper discusses
                 arguments from computer vision and psychology showing that
                 vision is ``intelligent'' and involves elements of ``problem
                 solving.'' The cases of apparently intelligent interpretation
                 sometimes cited in support of this claim do not show cognitive
                 penetration; rather, they show that certain natural
                 constraints on interpretation, concerned primarily with
                 optical and geometrical properties of the world, have been
                 compiled into the visual system. The paper also examines a
                 number of examples where instructions and ``hints'' are
                 alleged to affect what is seen. In each case it is concluded
                 that the evidence is more readily assimilated to the view that
                 when cognitive effects are found, they have a locus outside
                 early vision, in such processes as the allocation of focal
                 attention and the identification of the stimulus.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: Virtual reality (VR) is increasingly used as
                 simulation technology in emergency medicine education and
                 training, in particular for training nontechnical skills.
                 Experimental studies comparing teaching and learning in VR
                 with traditional training media often demonstrate the
                 equivalence or even superiority regarding particular variables
                 of learning or training effectiveness. OBJECTIVE: In the
                 EPICSAVE (Enhanced Paramedic Vocational Training with Serious
                 Games and Virtual Environments) project, a highly immersive
                 room-scaled multi-user 3-dimensional VR simulation environment
                 was developed. In this feasibility study, we wanted to gain
                 initial insights into the training effectiveness and media use
                 factors influencing learning and training in VR. METHODS: The
                 virtual emergency scenario was anaphylaxis grade III with
                 shock, swelling of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as
                 well as skin symptoms in a 5-year-old girl (virtual patient)
                 visiting an indoor family amusement park with her grandfather
                 (virtual agent). A cross-sectional, one-group pretest and
                 posttest design was used to evaluate the training
                 effectiveness and quality of the training execution. The
                 sample included 18 active emergency physicians. RESULTS: The
                 18 participants rated the VR simulation training positive in
                 terms of training effectiveness and quality of the training
                 execution. A strong, significant correlation (r=.53, P=.01)
                 between experiencing presence and assessing training
                 effectiveness was observed. Perceived limitations in usability
                 and a relatively high extraneous cognitive load reduced this
                 positive effect. CONCLUSIONS: The training within the virtual
                 simulation environment was rated as an effective educational
                 approach. Specific media use factors appear to modulate
                 training effectiveness (ie, improvement through ``experience
                 of presence'' or reduction through perceived limitations in
                 usability). These factors should be specific targets in the
                 further development of this VR simulation training.",

               offer well-known approaches for establishing safe work
               practices, serious games in virtual reality (VR) are used more
               often as a complementary approach for active, personalized
               learning experiences. Their designs yet have to take full
               advantage of how trainees can potentially manipulate and
               interact with virtual objects. In addition, little construction
               safety research has focused on generating and analyzing the
               inherent data that can be collected about the trainees' actions
               in the virtual environment. The objective analysis of their
               performance in the virtual environment offers precise feedback
               to sensitize their work behavior later in real practice. This
               research presents a novel framework for the generation and
               assessment of the trainees' data in augmented virtuality (AV).
               The proposed approach is tested in a virtual work environment
               consisting of multiple stages and hazards that are consistent
               within today's construction sites and workshops. A real angle

               performance in the proposed system and the experiences of two
               groups of volunteering participants are presented and discussed.
               An outlook presents future avenues towards enhancing existing

                Intelligence in Education (AIED) is a much younger discipline,
                but during the last 25 years there have been achievements in a

                expectation of AIED and its potential impact on education. The
                aim of this study was to analyse and discuss AIED from the
                teacher perspective. This study was carried out as a
                SWOT-analysis, with data gathered from a literature study. Main
                keywords in the literature search were: artificial
                intelligence, artificial intelligence in education, AIED,
                teacher perspective, education and teacher. Themes and patterns
                in the four main categories where further processed as a
                deductive-inductive thematic analysis. Findings indicates that
                there are both promises and threats for the teacher in the
                contemporary AIED. In several aspects the field seems to be in

                 self-practice of the ABCDE approach (Airways, Breathing,
                 Circulation, Disability, Exposure) in an immersive and
                 interactive virtual reality (VR) application gave non-inferior
                 learning outcome compared to using traditional equipment (TP)
                 in first year medical and nursing students. METHODS: A
                 non-inferior parallel group randomized controlled trial. The
                 study was linked to a regular teaching program conducted in
                 August and September 2019. All students participated in a
                 15-min ABCDE introduction session, before they self-practiced
                 the ABCDE approach for 20 min in either a fully immersive and
                 interactive VR application using hand controllers with some
                 haptic feedback (Individual VR) or with blood pressure gauge,
                 ear-thermometer and oximeter (Individual TP). The primary
                 outcome was the number of students who documented all the
                 eight predefined observations in the ABCDE approach in the
                 correct order in a practical test on an advanced simulator
                 manikin with a time limit of 5 min, done immediately after the
                 self-practice. The predefined one-sided non-inferiority limit
                 was 13\% points. RESULTS: Of all eligible students, 84\%
                 participated in the study and randomly allocated to VR (n =
                 149) or TP (n = 140). The primary outcome showed
                 non-inferiority of the VR application with 24.8\% in
                 individual VR doing all observations in correct order compared
                 to 27.1\% TP (absolute difference 2.3\% points, one sided 95\%
                 CI 2.3 to 10.8). The secondary outcomes were similar between
                 the groups, but more students in VR reported liking the way
                 they practiced (absolute difference 46\% points, 95\% CI 36.5
                 to 56.6) and that it was a good way to learn (36.9\% points,
                 95\% CI 26.8 to 47). VR also scored high on the System
                 Usability Scale (mean difference 6.4\% points, 95\% CI
                 2.8-10.1). CONCLUSIONS: Individual self-practicing the ABCDE
                 approach in VR was non-inferior to individual self-practicing

               principles in the context of virtual reality technology-based
               instruction (i.e. games, simulation, virtual worlds) in K-12 or
               higher education settings. A total of 13 studies (N = 3081) in
               the category of games, 29 studies (N = 2553) in the category of
               games, and 27 studies (N = 2798) in the category of virtual
               worlds were meta-analyzed. The key inclusion criteria were that
               the study came from K-12 or higher education settings, used
               experimental or quasi-experimental research designs, and used a
               learning outcome measure to evaluate the effects of the virtual
               reality-based instruction.Results suggest games (FEM = 0.77; REM
               = 0.51), simulations (FEM = 0.38; REM = 0.41), and virtual
               worlds (FEM = 0.36; REM = 0.41) were effective in improving
               learning outcome gains. The homogeneity analysis of the effect
               sizes was statistically significant, indicating that the studies
               were different from each other. Therefore, we conducted
               moderator analysis using 13 variables used to code the studies.
               Key findings included that: games show higher learning gains
               than simulations and virtual worlds. For simulation studies,
               elaborate explanation type feedback is more suitable for
               declarative tasks whereas knowledge of correct response is more
               appropriate for procedural tasks. Students performance is
               enhanced when they conduct the game play individually than in a
               group. In addition, we found an inverse relationship between
               number of treatment sessions learning gains for games.With
               regards to the virtual world, we found that if students were
               repeatedly measured it deteriorates their learning outcome
               gains. We discuss results to highlight the importance of
               considering instructional design principles when designing

               was offered at Michigan Technological University (MTU) for the

              while the completion times are not significantly affected by the

              them: they are decreased by the male gender in itself, while they

               examine whether there is a relationship between the

               cognitive characteristics: namely the spatial memory (measured

               no relationship between the examined spatial abilities and work
               effectiveness. For navigating in the virtual space, the built-in
               CogiNav technology of MaxWhere was used. The participants rated

                 fundamental changes in the way we perceive and conceive of our
                 environments; (2) we think with our bodies not just with our
                 brains; (3) we know more by doing than by seeing -- there are
                 times when physically performing an activity is better than
                 watching someone else perform the activity, even though our
                 motor resonance system fires strongly during other person
                 observation; (4) there are times when we literallythinkwith
                 things. These four ideas have major implications for

               to the following structuring of measures: tests that a priori

               the process of learning, self-reports of how learners

               principles and learning activities. Multiple representations can
               play a complementary role when learners exploit differences in
               their form and content by switching between and selecting the
               appropriate representation for the task at hand. Constraining
               benefits are achieved when learners can profit from the support
               of a familiar representation to understand a new and complex
               representation. Finally, if learners abstract across multiple
               representations, they can construct a deeper understanding of
               the nature of the representations and the domain they represent.

               information including irrelevant information, the same
               information presented concurrently in multiple forms or in
               unnecessarily elaborated form. According to cognitive load
               theory, processing redundant information with essential

               with learning. Eliminating such redundant information removes
               the requirement to process unnecessary sources of information.
               Accordingly, instructional designs that eliminate redundant
               material can be superior to those that include redundancy. This

               the depicted subject matter are progressively and cumulatively

               fundamental design. By giving due consideration to both
               perceptual and cognitive aspects of animation processing, the
               Animation Processing Model that embodies this Principle opens
               the door to novel, more effective compositional design options.

               incorporate multimedia design principles. In short, immersive
               media do not necessarily improve learning but effective
               instructional methods within immersive virtual environments do
               improve learning. The goal of effective instructional design in
               immersive virtual environments is to promote processes of
               selecting, organizing, and integrating information.
               Psychological presence -- the subjective experience of ``being

               learning environments that can motivate learners to engage in

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: The objective of this meta-analysis is to explore
                 the presently available, empirical findings on transfer of
                 training from virtual (VR), augmented (AR), and mixed reality
                 (MR) and determine whether such extended reality (XR)-based
                 training is as effective as traditional training methods.
                 BACKGROUND: MR, VR, and AR have already been used as training
                 tools in a variety of domains. However, the question of
                 whether or not these manipulations are effective for training
                 has not been quantitatively and conclusively answered.
                 Evidence shows that, while extended realities can often be
                 time-saving and cost-saving training mechanisms, their
                 efficacy as training tools has been debated. METHOD: The
                 current body of literature was examined and all qualifying
                 articles pertaining to transfer of training from MR, VR, and
                 AR were included in the meta-analysis. Effect sizes were
                 calculated to determine the effects that XR-based factors,
                 trainee-based factors, and task-based factors had on
                 performance measures after XR-based training. RESULTS: Results
                 showed that training in XR does not express a different
                 outcome than training in a nonsimulated, control environment.
                 It is equally effective at enhancing performance. CONCLUSION:
                 Across numerous studies in multiple fields, extended realities
                 are as effective of a training mechanism as the commonly
                 accepted methods. The value of XR then lies in providing
                 training in circumstances, which exclude traditional methods,
                 such as situations when danger or cost may make traditional
                 training impossible.",

               active learners through consciously attending to, and reflecting
               on, critique leveraging reflexivity and novel meaning-making
               most likely to lead to a conceptual change. This paper employs
               eleven industrial case-studies to highlight the application of
               multimodal VR-based teaching and training as a pedagogically
               rich strategy that may be designed, mapped and visualized
               through distinct VR-design elements and features. The outcomes
               of the use cases contribute to discern in-VR multimodal teaching
               as an emerging discourse that couples system design-based
               paradigms with embodied, situated and reflective praxis in
               spatial, emotional and temporal VR learning environments.",

                 students (ages 10--11 years) using a head-mounted display and

              they need to develop a common spatial frame of reference and then
              choose a space coding to describe the objects' positions. In this
              paper, we consider how the content of a virtual environment can
              influence communication between users. We designed two studies in
              which one participant (the speaker) had to indicate the position
              of one object to another participant (the addressee). The virtual
              environment was sometimes enriched by additional (proximal and
              distal) visual cues. In study 1, we considered statements
              production. We observed that the speakers most often used the
              avatar of their partner as a spatial reference to indicate a
              localization in the virtual space (i.e., Addressee-Centered
              coding) despite it increases their mental workload. Nevertheless,
              in complex situations, they also used distal cues to speak to the
              addressees (i.e., Exocentric coding of the space). In study 2, we
              considered statements comprehension. Addressee-Centered coding
              and Exocentric coding were used by the speakers in various
              spatial configurations to indicate the object position. We
              observed that Exocentric coding is the most difficult to manage
              for the addressee. These results indicate that speakers
              implemented the principle of less collaborative effort by
              adopting a way of exchanging information based on an asymmetrical
              cognitive cost, taking into consideration each other's
              difficulties. This allows a balanced mental workload to be
              maintained between the two operators throughout the task.",

  abstract = "Workforce training is needed throughout the construction industry
              to create and maintain competent workers; unfortunately, most
              construction training and education research focuses on
              university student education. The focus of this dissertation
              research is the current state of educational-theory embedded
              construction workforce training, how such trainings are
              effective, and how they may be further optimized based on
              established educational theory. This is accomplished through a
              review of construction training for current industry
              professionals, an evaluation of the assessment criteria used to
              measure effectiveness, followed by the creation of a framework
              for construction training. There is a lack of recommendations for
              improvement of construction training across the industry. To
              establish the current state of construction industry training, a
              review of education theory-integrated training for construction
              professionals is undertaken. To measure the extent of educational
              theory integration, this dissertation summarizes studies that
              meet inclusion criteria, identifies the frequency of occurrence
              of Bloom's Taxonomy verbs as a measure of student learning
              outcomes, and identifies and compares commonly used words within
              the identified construction training literature and foundational
              educational theory literature. The results provide a baseline of
              education theory-integrated construction training research, from
              which gaps and best practices can be identified. Existing
              construction training programs are not properly measured for
              effectiveness. A review of the current methodologies used in
              construction trainings published in archival literature is
              conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs.
              These practices are compared against the Kirkpatrick Model, an
              evaluation framework. The assessment methodologies in the
              literature are synthesized with corresponding levels found in the
              Kirkpatrick Model. Properly integrating educational theory into
              construction workforce training has the potential to improve
              industry training; however, there is a dearth of studies that
              present details of this integration process. To address this gap,
              a training framework is created to educate material installers on
              material properties, selection, and installation. This framework
              is based on andragogical and Universal Design for Learning (UDL)
              principles. An assessment tool provides a method of evaluating
              similar training agendas to improve instructional design before
              training implementation. The created framework culminates by
              establishing linkages from educational theory to proposed
              training modules.",

               persons with disabilities compared to traditional perspective

               biased towards the development of national policy and curriculum
               and pedagogical theory. To address this limitation in
               educational research, this article promotes rigorous historical
               studies that are more substantially grounded in the appropriate
               historiographical literature and utilise a wide range of
               original primary sources. Finally, the article explores a
               specific example of the way in which a historical approach may
               be fruitfully applied to a particular contemporary debate
               concerning the nature and purpose of religious education.",

  abstract    = "As medical education research continues to diversify
                 methodologically and theoretically, medical education
                 researchers have been increasingly willing to challenge
                 taken-for-granted assumptions about the form, content and
                 function of medical education. In this AMEE guide we describe
                 historical, discourse and text analysis approaches that can
                 help researchers and educators question the inevitability of
                 things that are currently seen as 'natural'. Why is such
                 questioning important? By articulating our assumptions and
                 interrogating the 'naturalness' of the status quo, one can
                 then begin to ask why things are the way they are. Researchers
                 can, for example, ask whether the models of medical education
                 organization and delivery that currently seem 'natural' to
                 them have been developed in order to provide the most benefit
                 to students or patients--or whether they have, rather, been
                 developed in ways that provide power to faculty members,
                 medical schools or the medical profession as a whole. An
                 understanding of the interplay of practices and power is a
                 valuable tool for opening up the field to new possibilities
                 for better medical education. The recognition that our current
                 models, rather than being 'natural', were created in
                 particular historical contexts for any number of contingent
                 reasons leads inexorably to the possibility of change. For if
                 our current ways of doing things are not, in fact, inevitable,
                 not only can they be questioned, they can be made better; they
                 can changed in ways that are attentive to whom they benefit,
                 are congruent with our current beliefs about best practice and
                 may lead to the production of better doctors.",

               research students, and even early career researchers, find
               elusive to articulate, and challenging to apply in their
               research proposals. Adopting an ethnographic and hermeneutic
               methodology, the present paper draws upon our experiences as
               lecturers in Research Methods over many years, and upon
               pertinent literature to explain the meaning of research
               paradigm. The paper elucidates the key aspects of research
               paradigms that researchers should understand well to be able to
               address this concept adequately in their research proposals. It
               offers suggestions on how researchers can locate their research

  abstract  = "The `traditional' construction industry has constantly been
               challenged to improve its inherent problematic practices.
               Offsite production (OSP), under the umbrella of modern methods
               of construction (MMC), has been acknowledged as a means to help
               improve construction industry performance as well as meet new
               market demands through the provision of improved, adaptable, and
               sustainable buildings. However, the deployment of OSP systems,
               if not managed properly, may adversely affect the end result and
               be counterproductive. It is therefore imperative that the
               construction industry stakeholders learn and appreciate the
               specifics, merits, as well as the risks associated with OSP
               systems in order to achieve the desired outcomes and
               consequently improve industry performance.On-the-job-training
               (OJT) is usually sought to facilitate `experiential' learning,
               which is argued to be particularly effective where a great deal
               of independence is granted to the task performer. However, OJT
               has been criticised for being expensive, limited, and sometimes
               devoid of the actual training context. In order to address the
               problems encountered with OJT, several virtual reality (VR)
               solutions have been proposed. This paper introduces one such VR
               solution prototype, in order to provide a risk-free environment
               for learning without the `do-or-die' consequences often faced on
               real construction projects. The proffered solution provides a
               unique VR environment for practicing new working conditions
               associated with OSP practices. While the `scenes' of the VR
               environment take place on a construction site, the environment
               predominantly targets professionals, such as project managers,
               construction managers, architects, designers, suppliers and
               manufacturers, to allow multidisciplinary learning to occur, and
               hence overcome `knowledge silos' or `knowledge
               compartmentation'. The VR environment enables unforeseen
               problems often caused by professionals' decisions, faulty work,
               and health and safety issues to occur; where the implications of
               which can be evaluated in respect of time, cost and resources.
               The VR environment proposed does not aim to resolve problems
               associated with OSP per se, rather aims to allow `things to go
               wrong' and consequently allows users not only to `experience'
               the resulting implications but also to reflect on those
               implications as part of the learning process. This paper
               discusses and presents the prototype for the first development
               phase of the VR interactive training environment. While the
               prototype was tested and validated with domain experts from
               industry, the research community, and academia from different EU
               countries, the data used in developing the prototype was
               constrained to one project in the UK which may limit the
               generalisability of results.",

  abstract  = "Abstract The UK construction industry has long been criticized
               for its poor performance, poor image and inability to attract
               and retain workers. Offsite production (OSP) under the
               overarching umbrella of modern methods of construction (MMC) was
               sought by the UK Government to ameliorate the UK construction
               industry, meet market demands and overcome manual skill
               shortages. Nevertheless, professional skills shortages are
               argued to be as acute as manual skills shortfalls. In this
               respect, industry?academia collaboration is anticipated to
               provide professional skills needed for OSP and, hence, effect
               change. This paper reports the findings from the first stage of
               an ongoing triangulated research project. In this context, a
               survey was carried out to capture the perceptions of both the UK

               The findings from 36 large construction organizations
               (representing a 20\% response rate) and 20 construction-related
               higher-education institutions (representing a 32\% response
               rate) suggested that although the industry considered OSP to be
               the future of the UK construction industry, there seemed to be
               uncertainty about what OSP actually entailed. Notwithstanding
               these issues, academia either did not know or refuted that OSP
               is the future of the construction industry, hence suggesting a
               lack of shared understanding between industry and academia with
               respect to skills requirements and preferred means for

               learners is difficult to replace and remains a primary challenge
               in the field. Conversational agents may alleviate this problem
               by engaging in natural interaction and by scaffolding learners'

               proposed for integrating visual aspects of the sketching process
               into 3D sketch-based modeling systems. In particular,
               artist-drawn construction aids called visual scaffolding are
               explored. Two scaffolding components which simulate elements of
               pencil sketching, geometric massing and eraser marks, are
               integrated into a rendering pipeline which also includes a suite
               of new object-space techniques for high-fidelity pen-and-ink
               depiction of implicit surfaces. Based on a hybrid, hierarchical
               approach which leverages both the implicit surface definition
               and an underlying coarse tessellation, new methods are described
               for computing silhouettes, suggestive contours, surface
               stippling, and surfel-based visibility culling. These techniques
               are real-time but require no pre-computation, allowing them to
               be applied to dynamic hierarchical implicit surfaces, and are
               demonstrated in ShapeShop, an interactive sketch-based modeling
               tool. The result is a real-time display pipeline which
               composites these novel scaffolding and pen-and-ink techniques to

               articulating and amplifying that knowledge. A theoretical
               framework is developed which provides an analytical perspective

               diverse range of psychopathology. CBT, as it exists today, is a
               composite of techniques derived from behavioral, cognitive, and
               social learning theories. Behavioral learning principles
               underlie exposure therapy, one of the most efficacious
               interventions to date, as well as a handful of diverse CBT
               interventions, which apply principles of reinforcement to
               decrease maladaptive behaviors. Cognitive strategies within CBT
               utilize principles from theories of constructivism, attribution
               theory, and metacognition to aid clients in learning how
               thoughts impact feelings. Finally, social learning theory, which
               focuses on learning in the context of interpersonal
               relationships, interactions, and observations, plays a role in
               CBT, relying heavily upon both therapist instruction and the
               active role of the participant. This chapter provides an
               overview of how these learning theories guide CBT strategies,
               yielding considerations for both clinicians and researchers on
               how to enhance learning within CBT.",

                 Australia required all workers in construction to complete
                 mandatory safety awareness training before they began work on
                 site. During the implementation of this new legislation there
                 was considerable resistance from the construction sector due
                 to the mandatory nature of the training. The construction
                 industry viewed this as an unnecessary impost as they
                 considered that there was already sufficient safety training
                 delivered through individual company and site inductions. In
                 2010, we evaluated the new Construction Induction Training
                 (CIT) in the commercial construction sector in Western
                 Australia to find that since 2007 there has been an
                 unanticipated change in support for the mandatory training.
                 The 2010 study shows a shift in the values of the safety
                 culture for the commercial sector of the construction
                 industry. In 2010, the industry not only supports the
                 mandatory CIT, but is very vocal in its request to
                 re-institute the refresher courses that were withdrawn in
                 2009. Indeed, 79\% of respondents claimed there were
                 measurable benefits to their business having their employees
                 complete the CIT, while 96\% claimed the CIT assisted in
                 reducing accidents/incidents on their worksites. This 2010
                 study indicates that in this case, mandatory training has had
                 a positive effect on safety culture change and gradually
                 reduced work-related injury in the industry since 2007 to the
                 present. The paper uses data from two studies conducted in
                 2006 and 2010 to highlight the unanticipated change in
                 perception of the value of mandatory safety training in the WA

                 evidence that specialized (sports) motor experience enhances
                 action-related language understanding by recruitment of left
                 dorsal lateral premotor cortex, a region normally devoted to
                 higher-level action selection and implementation-even when
                 there is no intention to perform a real action. Experience
                 playing and watching sports has enduring effects on language
                 understanding by changing the neural networks that subserve
                 comprehension to incorporate areas active in performing sports
                 skills. Without such experience, sport novices recruit
                 lower-level sensory-motor regions, thought to support the
                 instantiation of movement, during language processing, and
                 activity in primary motor areas does not help comprehension.
                 Thus, the language system is sufficiently plastic and dynamic
                 to encompass expertise-related neural recruitment outside core
                 language networks.",

               industries have been evolving from traditional practices into
               more current, interdisciplinary and technology integrated
               methods. Complex and intricate digital technologies and mobile
               computing such as simulation, computational design and immersive
               technologies, have been exploited for different purposes such as
               reducing cost and time, improving design and enhancing overall
               project efficiency. Immersive technologies and augmented reality
               (AR), in particular, have proven to be extremely beneficial in
               this field. However, the application and usage of these
               technologies and devices in higher education teaching and
               learning environments are yet to be fully explored and still
               scarce. More importantly, there is still a significant gap in
               developing pedagogies and teaching methods that embrace the
               usage of such technologies in the AC curricula. This study,
               therefore, aims to critically analyse the current
               state-of-the-art and present the developed and improved AR
               approaches in teaching and learning methods of AC, addressing
               the identified gap in the extant literature, while developing
               transformational frameworks to link the gaps to their future
               research agenda. The conducted analysis incorporates the
               critical role of the AR implications on the AC students'
               skillsets, pedagogical philosophies in AC curricula,
               techno-educational aspects and content domains in the design and
               implementation of AR environments for AC learning. The outcomes
               of this comprehensive study prepare trainers, instructors, and

@ARTICLE{Collins1991-es,
  title    = "Cognitive Apprenticeship: Making Thinking Visible",
  author   = "Collins, A and Brown, J and Holum, A",
  abstract = "IN ANCIENT times, teaching and learning were accomplished through
              apprenticeship: We taught our children how to speak, grow crops,
              craft cabinets, or tailor clothes by showing them how and by
              helping them do it. Apprenticeship was the vehicle for
              transmitting the knowledge required for expert practice in fields
              from painting and sculpting to medicine and law. It was the
              natural way to learn. In modern times, apprenticeship has largely
              been replaced by formal schooling, except in children's learning
              of language, in some aspects of graduate education, and in
              on-the-job training. We propose an alternative model of
              instruction that is accessible within the framework of the
              typical American classroom. It is a model of instruction that
              goes back to apprenticeship but incorporates elements of
              schooling. We call this model ``cognitive apprenticeship'' While
              there are many differences between schooling and apprenticeship
              methods, we will focus on one. In apprenticeship, learners can
              see the processes of work: They watch a parent sow, plant, and
              harvest crops and help as they are able; they assist a tradesman
              as he crafts a cabinet; they piece together garments under the
              supervision of a more experienced tailor. Apprenticeship involves
              learning a physical, tangible activity. But in schooling, the
              ``practice'' of problem solving, reading comprehension, and
              writing is not at all obvious-it is not necessarily observable to
              the student. In apprenticeship, the processes of the activity are
              visible. In schooling, the processes of thinking are often
              invisible to both the students and the teacher. Cognitive
              apprenticeship is a model of instruction that works to make
              thinking visible. In this article, we will present some of the
              features of traditional apprenticeship and discuss the ways it
              can be adapted to the teaching and learning of cognitive skills.
              Then we will present three successful examples-cases in which
              teachers and researchers have used apprenticeship methods to
              teach reading, writing, and mathematics. In the final section, we
              organize our ideas about the characteristics of successful
              teaching into a general framework for the design of learning
              environments, where ``environment'' includes the content taught,
              the pedagogical methods employed, the sequencing of learning
              activities, and the sociology of learning. Although schools have
              been relatively successful in organizing and conveying large
              bodies of conceptual and factual knowledge, standard pedagogical
              practices render key aspects of expertise invisible to students.
              Too little attention is paid to the reasoning and strategies that
              experts employ when they acquire knowledge or …",

               design research within HCI. Following a research through design
               approach, designers produce novel integrations of HCI research
               in an attempt to make the right thing: a product that transforms
               the world from its current state to a preferred state. This
               model allows interaction designers to make research
               contributions based on their strength in addressing
               under-constrained problems. To formalize this model, we provide
               a set of four lenses for evaluating the research contribution

              characterization of design, we focus on the guiding values or
              ideals of the discipline. We first reason from the notion of
              engineering interfaces for usability and utility up to the 1990s
              to the current ideal of designing interfaces for experience and
              meaning. Next, we identify three recent technical and societal
              developments that are challenging the existing ideals of
              interaction design, namely the move towards hybrid
              physical/digital materials, the emergence of an increasingly
              complex and fluid digital ecology, and the increasing proportion
              of autonomous or partially autonomous systems changing their
              behavior over time and with use. These challenges in turn
              motivate us to propose three directions in which new ideals for
              interaction design might be sought: the first is to go beyond the
              language-body divide that implicitly frames most of our current
              understandings of experience and meaning, the second is to extend
              the scope of interaction design from individual interfaces to the
              complex sociotechnical fabric of human and nonhuman actors, and
              the third is to go beyond predictability by learning to design
              with machine learning.",

               shortages in the labour market with special emphasis on the
               construction sector in the European Union Member States,
               foreseeing the Construction 4.0 era. The free movement of people
               is one of the rights of all citizens of the EU which also
               includes the free movement of workers. Labour shortages in the
               EU are expected to increase in the future due to a declining
               population and an ageing workforce. In order to recognize and
               forecast labour shortages, EU Member states use a variety of
               instruments but they do not answer as to whether it is possible
               to use migrant labour to appease those shortages. There are
               several systems used to classify labour shortages in the EU
               Member states. Most of the countries classify labour shortages
               in relation to different sectors or occupation groups as well as
               by skill levels, but in some Member States, classification is
               made according to the type of employment. Instruments used to
               measure labour shortages significantly differ from country to
               country. Several criteria are used for creating lists of
               shortage occupations and most of the criteria include demand
               side and supply side criteria. A majority of the Member States
               are facing labour and skill shortages in various sectors and the
               construction sector is not an exception. As total employment in
               the construction sector decreased, so did the share of employed
               migrants. Labour shortages in the construction sector can be
               eased by the availability of a labour supply willing to accept
               unqualified and low-paying jobs. The construction sector seeks
               low-, medium-, and high-skilled individuals and is most likely
               the sector where most of the incoming migrants will be working,
               which has an impact on the development and implementation

                physical and digital technologies in an integrated manner.
                Similarly, the authors envision that the Construction 4.0
                framework can fundamentally change the way that assets are
                designed, constructed, and operated. The idea of the
                Construction 4.0 developed from the need of the construction
                sector to overcome the existing horizontal, vertical, and
                longitudinal fragmentation and to take a holistic approach to
                the improvements needed in the industry. In this study, a
                literature review of Industry 4.0 and its influence on the

                literature review, the authors define the Construction 4.0

                implementation. A key finding of the study is that building
                information modeling, and a common data environment form the
                key foundation for the implementation of the Construction 4.0
                framework. In defining the Construction 4.0 framework, the
                paper described its components and how its implementation is

               early design stage",
  author    = "King Chun, Chan and Li, Heng and Skitmore, Martin",
  abstract  = "PurposeThe construction industry is well known for its high
               accident rate and many practitioners consider a preventative
               approach to be the most important means of bringing about
               improvements. The purpose of this paper is to address previous
               research and the weaknesses of existing preventative approaches
               and then to describe and illustrate a new application involving
               the use of a multi‐dimensional simulation tool -- Construction
               Virtual Prototyping (CVP).Design/methodology/approachA
               literature review was conducted to investigate previous studies
               of hazard identification and safety management and to develop
               the new approach. Due to weaknesses in current practice, the
               research study explored the use of computer simulation
               techniques to create virtual environments where users can
               explore and identify construction hazards. Specifically, virtual
               prototyping technology was deployed to develop typical
               construction scenarios in which unsafe or hazardous incidents
               occur. In a case study, the users' performance was evaluated
               based on their responses to incidents within the virtual
               environment and the effectiveness of the computer simulation
               system established though interviews with the safety project
               management team.FindingsThe opinions and suggestions provided by
               the interviewees led to the initial conclusion that the
               simulation tool was useful in assisting the safety management
               team's hazard identification process during the early design
               stage.Originality/valueThe paper introduces an innovative method
               to support the management team's reviews of construction site
               safety. The system utilises three‐dimensional modelling and
               four‐dimensional simulation of worker behaviour, a configuration
               that has previously not been employed in construction
               simulations. An illustration of the method's use is also
               provided, together with a consideration of its strengths and
               weaknesses.",

  abstract = "In 1965 a political initiative was taken launched to solve the
              lack of accommodation in Sweden, and during a ten- year period
              about one million new homes were built- the Million Homes
              programme. These buildings constitute about one fourth of the
              entire Swedish building stock and thus have a high societal
              value. Today they do not always meet current building standards
              and many are in need of refurbishment. The Million Homes
              programme incorporated a large variety of technical building
              solutions, andknowledge about former building practices is needed
              if refurbishment is to be successful. Industrialised builders in
              Sweden have recognized the use of a platform as one means of
              sharing knowledge. A platform is essentially the collection of
              assets that are shared by a set of products. In a platform for
              housing refurbishment the assets have knowledge and process
              content (as opposed to product content) and will probably also
              contain many relationships. The interview study carried out as
              part of the research shows that the main purpose of a platform
              concept is to standardize components and processes. To increase
              the possibility that a platform concept for refurbishment of
              buildings will beused for knowledge sharing the focus should be
              on the individuals who will actually be sharing their knowledge
              and especially on social motivations. It is important that
              managers and leaders demonstrate knowledge sharing behaviors as
              this will lead to the establishment of a culture where knowledge
              sharing is the norm; in the context of this study this is
              especially important for the creation of an efficient platform
              concept for refurbishment.",

               recent years due to its benefits of providing an engaging and
               immersive environment. The objective of this review is to
               critically collect and analyze the VR applications in CEET,
               aiming at all VR-related journal papers published from 1997 to
               2017. The review follows a three-stage analysis on VR
               technologies, applications and future directions through a
               systematic analysis. It is found that the VR technologies
               adopted for CEET evolve over time, from desktop-based VR,
               immersive VR, 3D game-based VR, to Building Information
               Modelling (BIM)-enabled VR. A sibling technology, Augmented
               Reality (AR), for CEET adoptions has also emerged in recent
               years. These technologies have been applied in architecture and
               design visualization, construction health and safety training,
               equipment and operational task training, as well as structural

  abstract  = "In recent years, due to the rapid development of the fourth
               industrial revolution and new platforms of information

               attention in many industries and have brought the potential to
               improve the efficiency of the construction industry. These facts
               led to the appearance of a new concept in construction industry
               called Construction 4.0. Therefore, this article seeks to
               explore the state of implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies
               in the construction industry and analyze their impact on the
               formation of the Construction 4.0 concept. In order to achieve
               the aim of this article, a literature review was conducted using
               the most relevant publication in this field. Moreover, authors
               carried out a bibliometric analysis among 195 selected research
               articles related to the Industry 4.0 and Construction 4.0 to
               identify interconnections between these concepts. The results
               show that Industry 4.0 has the greatest impact on productivity
               growth in construction and that interest in digital technologies
               is growing every year, but their penetration into the
               construction industry is currently slow and limited. The authors

               is engineer-to-order. House-builders can pre-engineer their
               design to different degrees, resulting in variations of the
               engineer-to-order strategy: design-to-order, adapt-to-order, and
               engineer-to-stock. This variation causes different settings for
               the use of platforms in house-building. The aim of this research
               is to diversify the engineer-to-order production strategy and
               its consequences for platform organization by studying its use
               in house-building. The multiple case study on four
               engineering/contractor firms reports the core capabilities for
               engineer-to-order firms: procurement and tendering, market
               knowledge, engineering, multi-skilled manufacturing, and
               coordination of sales and manufacturing. Design-to-order,
               adapt-to-order and engineer-to stock were shown to be production
               strategies in use in house-building. In design-to-order
               platforms parts of the platform are undefined while
               engineer-to-stock platforms are fully predefined. Coordination
               between market and manufacturing is a crucial capability when
               engaging in platform organization. When an engineering firm and
               a contractor collaborate to fulfil client needs, the
               coordination capability between market and manufacturing was
               shown to be low. The case study shows that specialized
               contractors who integrate the supply chain towards a specific
               market segment benefit fully from the platform concept, while
               contractors with a wider scope could focus on standardization of

               social formations whose participants engage with each other as a
               condition and precondition for their existence, theories that
               conceive of learning as a special universal mental process
               impoverish and misrecognize it. My colleagues and I have been
               trying to convey out understanding of this claim for some years
               (e.g., Lave, 1988; Lave the absence of movement away from some
               putatively common starting point becomes grounds for labeling
               others sub-normal. The logic that makes success exceptional but
               nonetheless characterizes lack of success as not normal won't
               do. It reflects and contributes to a politics by which
               disinherited and disenfranchised individuals, whether taken one
               at a time or in masses, are identified as the disabled, and
               thereby made responsible for their ``plight'' (e.g., McDermott,
               1993). It seems imperative to explore ways of understanding
               learning that do not naturalize and underwrite divisions of
               social inequality in our society. A reconsideration of learning
               as a social, collective, rather than individual, psychological
               phenomenon offers the only way beyond the current state of
               affairs that I can envision at the present time.",

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: There is a mismatch between the broad range of
                 learning theories offered in the wider education literature
                 and a relatively narrow range of theories privileged in the
                 medical education literature. The latter are usually described
                 under the heading of 'adult learning theory'. METHODS: This
                 paper critically addresses the limitations of the current
                 dominant learning theories informing medical education. An
                 argument is made that such theories, which address how an
                 individual learns, fail to explain how learning occurs in
                 dynamic, complex and unstable systems such as fluid clinical
                 teams. RESULTS: Models of learning that take into account
                 distributed knowing, learning through time as well as space,
                 and the complexity of a learning environment including
                 relationships between persons and artefacts, are more powerful
                 in explaining and predicting how learning occurs in clinical
                 teams. Learning theories may be privileged for ideological
                 reasons, such as medicine's concern with autonomy.
                 CONCLUSIONS: Where an increasing amount of medical education
                 occurs in workplace contexts, sociocultural learning theories
                 offer a best-fit exploration and explanation of such learning.
                 We need to continue to develop testable models of learning
                 that inform safe work practice. One type of learning theory
                 will not inform all practice contexts and we need to think
                 about a range of fit-for-purpose theories that are testable in
                 practice. Exciting current developments include dynamicist
                 models of learning drawing on complexity theory.",

                 radical pedagogical innovation in medical education in the UK
                 during the 1990s. Part of this thinking was to include the
                 medical humanities as a medium for re-thinking medical
                 practice, especially how medical students might better learn
                 to communicate with patients and colleagues, and how they
                 might become agents of change in progressing medicine through
                 innovations. In designing the curriculum, Cultural-historical
                 Activity Theory (CHAT) was used as a model to 'think', or
                 reconceptualise, the purposes of a curriculum. The first
                 question asked was: 'what do patients want?' Emphasis was
                 placed on resisting a 'will-to-stability' in adopting safe

  abstract  = "The concept of human capital is very common in present-day
               construction industry with reference to its philosophy and
               techniques. Human capital (HC) is widely discussed in different
               fields; hence, its meanings differ from one field to another.
               This study provides a detailed discussion on the development of
               the human capital theory under various themes and sub-themes.
               The study further seeks to discuss the several effects of human
               capital development on industry success and competitiveness and
               how this contributes to economic growth in developing countries.
               Relevant literatures on HC theory and development were extracted
               from Scopus. Scopus is widely acknowledged as one of the widest
               interdisciplinary databases for engineering, technology, science
               and medicine. The Scopus database features over 20, 000+
               peer-reviewed journals from over 5000 publishers. The Scopus
               database allows its users to perform more detailed searching
               opportunities compared to other databases such as Academic
               Search Complete, Art and Architecture Complete, Ebsco Host,
               SpringerLink and Web of science. The distillation of literature
               through thematic analysis revealed the various roles of human
               capital and its correlation with construction industry success
               and growth. Findings from this study revealed that the success
               of the construction industry is firmly related to the
               effectiveness of its human capital. The study revealed that the
               human capital theory is not without its criticisms and barriers.
               Practically, this study explores the various benefits of human
               capital to employers of the construction industry. The study
               suggests that human capital development plays a key part in
               retaining quality employees and recruiting prospects.
               Furthermore, investment in human capital goes a long way in
               improving employee satisfaction, organisational culture and
               increased productivity. This study contributes to the human
               capital discourse, which is the measure of economic value

               interpretation of American business history during the formative
               years 1870-1920, which mark the dawn of modern big business. It
               focuses on four major revolutions that ushered in this new era:
               those in power, transportation, communication, and organization.
               Using the metaphor of America as an economic hothouse uniquely
               suited to rapid economic growth during these years, it analyzes
               the interplay of key factors such as entrepreneurial talent,
               technology, land, natural resources, law, mass markets, and the
               rise of cities. It also delineates the process that laid the
               foundation for the modern era, in which virtually every human
               activity became a business, and, in most cases, a big business.
               The book also profiles numerous major entrepreneurs whose
               careers and activities illustrate broader trends and themes. It
               utilizes a wide variety of sources, including novels from the
               period, to produce a lively narrative.",

               students from research problem to their written research report
               at the pace they need, with clear explanations, DIY tasks and
               study skills support. In a new landscape format it presents
               figures, models and visualizations elegantly, so they don't
               break over a page, making even complex concepts easier to
               understand. Two pathways: With an innovative, beautiful design,
               regular progress checkpoints have been built into the book and
               its online resources. As students proceed through the 8 steps,
               each chapter provides regular opportunities for students to
               check understanding or give themselves a challenge. Each pathway
               then gives them the resources they need. Confused? Stop,
               practise with quizzes and flashcards, or use a video to look at
               a concept a different way. Up for a challenge? Access a wealth

               case studies, activities, bibliography tools and inspiration to
               pursue your curiosity, impress your lecturer, and nail your

  author    = "Dainty, Andrew R J and Bagilhole, Barbara M and Neale, Richard H",
  abstract  = "In response to impending skills shortages and changing
               employment patterns, the UK construction industry recently has
               made considerable efforts to attract more women to its
               professions. However, despite their increasing representation,
               there are indications that women experience difficulties in
               developing their careers within the industry. This research
               investigated the careers of men and women working for large
               construction companies, in order to establish the gender
               determined influences on women's career progression. A primarily
               qualitative methodology was employed for the research, in which
               career profiles were developed through ethnographic interviews
               with 41 matched pairs of male and female employees. This allowed
               the gender specific determinants of careers to be established
               across a range of different organizations, and from informants
               at different vocational and life-cycle stages. The analysis
               resulted in the formulation of a set of eight interrelated
               theoretical models, from which a theory of women's career
               development was constructed. The theory reflects the belief that
               the construction workplace is a competitive and conflictual
               environment, where women are overtly and covertly discriminated
               against by men, who use structural systems to undermine their
               participation. The women interviewed were found to have dealt
               with these barriers in a way which perpetuated existing work
               cultures. If reflected throughout the industry, this would
               suggest the existence of a self-fulfilling cycle of women's
               continued under-achievement. The paper puts forward the radical
               proposition that women should not be attracted to the industry
               unless steps are taken to moderate its exclusionary and
               discriminatory culture.",

  abstract  = "Construction crisis management research is in an exploratory
               state where contemplated questions are of more value than hasty
               answers. For this reason, this paper is more concerned with
               theory formulation than theory testing. More specifically, it
               derives a grounded theory of construction crisis management
               which forms a useful basis for future research. It does so from
               an investigation of the complex patterns of communication and
               behaviour which emerge in response to construction crises. The
               conclusion is that construction crisis management is about the
               effective control of social and behavioural instability and the
               conflict which arises out of it. However, effective crisis
               management is made difficult by the in-built defence mechanisms
               which construction crises appear to have. The grounded theory
               also is contrasted with current crisis management theory and
               thereby, the uniqueness of crisis management in a construction
               context is identified.",

               to capture rich information for the purpose of the investigation

               meaningful characteristics of real?life events. Subsequent to
               data capture, data analysis will take place according to the

               certain information to be hidden within the data and diluted
               during this data analysis phase. In order to minimize this and
               to reveal informal aspects and freshly emerging themes from the
               case study data, it is proposed that there is great value in
               analysing case studies on various levels, through different

               From the findings, the limits of the formal management systems

                 our understanding of a single concept, in this case:
                 veterinary workplace clinical training (WCT), which occurs
                 just prior to students' graduation as competent veterinary
                 surgeons. The competency movement has strongly influenced
                 reforms in veterinary education and is considered important.
                 In reflection of this, the term ``preparedness'' is
                 operationalised here as a measure of the likelihood that the

               study-based review and future pathways",
  author    = "Boafo, Fred and Kim, Jin-Hee and Kim, Jun-Tae",
  abstract  = "Even though tightened building energy efficiency standards are
               implemented periodically in many countries, existing buildings
               continually consume a momentous quota of the total primary
               energy. Energy efficiency solutions range from material
               components to bulk systems. A technique of building
               construction, referred to as prefabricated architecture
               (prefab), is increasing in reputation. Prefab encompasses the
               offsite fabrication of building components to a greater degree
               of finish as bulk building structures and systems, and their
               assembly on-site. In this context, prefab improves the speed of
               construction, quality of architecture, efficiency of materials,
               and worker safety, while limiting environmental impacts of
               construction, as compared to conventional site-built
               construction practices. Quite recently, a 57 story skyscraper
               was built in 19 days using prefabricated modules. From the
               building physics point of view, the bulk systems and tighter
               integration method of prefab minimizes thermal bridges. This
               study seeks to clearly characterize the levels of prefab and to
               investigate the performance of modular prefab; considering
               acoustic constrain, seismic resistance, thermal behavior, energy
               consumption, and life cycle analysis of existing prefab cases
               and, thus, provides a dynamic case study-based review.
               Generally, prefab can be categorized into components, panels
               (2D), modules (3D), hybrids, and unitized whole buildings. On
               average, greenhouse gas emissions from conventional construction
               were higher than for modular construction, not discounting some
               individual discrepancies. Few studies have focused on monitored
               data on prefab and occupants' comfort but additional studies are
               required to understand the public's perception of the
               technology. The scope of the work examined will be of interest
               to building engineers, manufacturers, and energy experts, as

                 frame the performance of social similarity and difference. It
                 argues that 'the social' does not exist as a single spatial
                 type, but rather performs itself in a recursive and
                 topologically heterogeneous manner. Using material drawn from
                 a study of the way in which tropical doctors handle anaemia,
                 it explores three different social topologies. First, there
                 are 'regions' in which objects are clustered together, and
                 boundaries are drawn round each cluster. Second, there are
                 'networks' in which distance is a function of relations
                 between elements, and difference a matter of relational
                 variety. These two forms of spatiality are often mobilized in
                 social theory. However, we argue that there are other kinds of
                 social space, and here consider the possible character of a
                 third, that of 'fluid spatiality'. In this, places are neither
                 delineated by boundaries, nor linked through stable relations:
                 instead, entities may be similar and dissimilar at different
                 locations within fuid space. In addition, they may transform
                 themselves without creating difference.",

                 hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has demonstrated several
                 deficits in many aspects. However, no previous study employed
                 quantitative methodology providing objective measures that
                 could be compared among different studies with diverse
                 samples. To fill this gap, we used network analysis to
                 investigate how ADHD symptomatology impacts narrative
                 discourse, a complex linguistic task considered to be an
                 ecological measure of language. Fifty-eight adults (34 females
                 and 24 males) with a mean age of 26 years old and a mean of 17
                 years of educational level were administered the Adult
                 Self-Rating Scale for ADHD symptomatology. They also completed
                 the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, the Beck Depression
                 Inventory and the Urgency, Premeditation, Perseverance,
                 Sensation Seeking Behavior Scale. Intelligence quotient was
                 calculated. Individuals were asked to tell a story based on a
                 wordless picture book. Speech was recorded and transcribed as
                 an input to SpeechGraphs software. Parameters were total
                 number of words (TNW), number of loops of one node (L1),
                 repeated edges (RE), largest strongly connected component
                 (LSC) and average shortest path (ASP). Verbosity was
                 controlled. Statistical analysis was corrected for multiples
                 comparisons and partial correlations were performed for
                 confounding variables. After controlling for anxiety,
                 depression, IQ, and impulsiveness ADHD symptomatology was
                 positively correlated with L1 and negatively correlated with
                 LSC. TNW was positively correlated with ADHD symptoms. In a
                 subdomain analysis, both inattention and
                 hyperactivity-impulsivity were negatively correlated with LSC.
                 Only hyperactivity-impulsivity positively correlated with TNW
                 and L1. Results indicated a correlation between ADHD symptoms
                 and lower connectedness in narrative discourse (as indicated
                 by higher L1 and lower LSC), as well as higher total number of
                 words (TNW). Our results suggest that the higher the number of
                 ADHD symptoms, the less connectivity among words, and a higher

                 in humans and differs widely among individuals. Despite its
                 importance, however, the malleability of this skill through
                 practice has scarcely been studied empirically, in contrast to
                 psychometric spatial ability. Thus, this article examines the
                 possibility of improving the accuracy of configurational
                 understanding of the environment by training. A total of 40
                 adults with a poor sense of direction participated in the
                 experiment; and were randomly assigned to either a condition
                 in which they received feedback only or a condition in which
                 they additionally practiced allocentric spatial updating.
                 Participants walked one route in each session, once a week for
                 6 weeks, and conducted spatial tasks designed to assess their
                 knowledge of the route. A total of 20 people with an average
                 sense of direction also participated as a comparison group.
                 Results showed that training in allocentric spatial updating
                 improved the accuracy of direction estimates, although the
                 size of the effect was limited: the improvement was not large
                 enough to equate the performance in the groups with a poor
                 versus average sense of direction. The two groups, however,
                 did not differ in spatial skill in mental rotation or path
                 integration. Feedback was effective for improving accuracy in
                 straight-line distance estimates and sketch maps: repeated
                 trials with feedback led to improved accuracy by the sixth
                 session to a level comparable to the group with an average
                 sense of direction. The results show that flexible translation
                 between viewer-centered and environment-centered
                 representations is difficult and not readily trainable, and
                 provide insights into the nature of individual differences in

              findings indicate Construction 4.0's positive impacts on
              environmental and economic sustainability that far outweigh its
              negative effects, although these impacts are comparable with
              regards to social sustainability. On Construction 4.0
              technologies itself, their application was found to be nonuniform
              with greater application seen for building information modeling
              and automation vis-{\`a}-vis others such as cyber-physical
              systems and smart materials, with significant growth expected in
              the future for blockchain- and three-dimensional-printing-related
              technologies. The proposed novel framework could enable the
              development of policy interventions and support mechanisms to
              increase Construction 4.0 deployment while addressing its
              negative sustainability-related impacts. The framework also has
              the potential to be adapted and applied to other country and
              sectoral contexts.",

              transformation of engineering and construction sectors",
  author   = "Wang, Kaiyang and Guo, Fangyu and Zhang, Cheng and Schaefer, Dirk",
  abstract = "Purpose The purpose of this study is to systematically identify,
              assess, and categorize the barriers to digital transformation
              (DT) in the engineering and construction sectors, and thus to
              better understand the impact and how these sectors might be
              overcome.Design/methodology/approach This study adopted a
              sequential mixed qualitative and quantitative data collection and
              analysis approach. DT barriers were first identified from
              relevant literature and verified by an expert panel. Then, a
              questionnaire survey assessing the impacts of the identified DT
              barriers was distributed to construction professionals in China,
              and 192 valid responses were retrieved. Further, the data
              obtained were analyzed using ranking analysis, exploratory factor
              analysis (EFA), and partial least squares-structural equation
              modeling (PLS-SEM).Findings Based on the ranking analysis, the
              top three barriers are ``lack of industry-specific standards and
              laws,'' ``lack of clear vision, strategy and direction for DT,''
              and ``lack of support from top management for DT.'' EFA enabled
              the grouping of the 26 barriers into 3 categories: (1) lack of
              laws and regulations (LLR), (2) lack of support and leadership
              (LSL), and (3) lack of resources and professionals (LRP). The
              PLS-SEM analysis revealed that LLR, LSL, and LRP were found to
              have significant negative impacts on DT.Originality/value These
              findings contribute to the body of knowledge on DT in the
              construction industry and help construction firms and government
              bodies improve the understanding of these barriers to DT and put
              forward relevant policies and incentives, thus seizing the DT
              benefits as a way to enhance construction project management.",

               science. The behavioral-science paradigm seeks to develop and
               verify theories that explain or predict human or organizational
               behavior. The design-science paradigm seeks to extend the
               boundaries of human and organizational capabilities by creating
               new and innovative artifacts. Both paradigms are foundational to
               the IS discipline, positioned as it is at the confluence of
               people, organizations, and technology. Our objective is to
               describe the performance of design-science research in

               guidelines for understanding, executing, and evaluating the

  abstract  = "A trade union is an organized association of workers formed for
               the protection and promotion of their common interests. The
               standard view of unions is that they are monopoly organizations
               that improve the welfare of members, principally by raising
               wages above the competitive level. For a union to be able to
               increase wage rates above the competitive level, there must be
               some surplus that can be shared between the firm and the union,
               and the union must have some bargaining power to induce the firm
               to share this surplus. This article investigates the conditions
               under which a union can increase wages, and explores ways of
               modeling the competing preferences of unions and management. The
               article also notes the arguments suggesting that, in the
               presence of imperfect information and uncertainty, unions may
               enhance efficiency. To the extent that unions reduce labor
               turnover and negotiating costs, they may increase the available
               surplus to be shared between parties.",

               The first section provides an historical overview of unions and
               how they have been organized spatially. Specifically, the
               section defines and contrasts different types of unionism --
               craft unionism, industrial unionism, geographical unionism --
               and also ponders some of the spatial implications of such
               different models -- unions in which decision making is highly
               decentralized have quite different geographical structures and
               loci of power than do those which are more centralized, for
               instance. The second section focuses upon how geographers have
               sought to investigate unions as geographical actors.
               Specifically, it addresses four areas of research upon which
               geographers have concentrated, these being: (1) how labor law
               and state regulation influence the ways in which unions are
               structured and operate geographically; (2) how unions have

  abstract    = "OBJECTIVE: Grounded theory (GT) is an established qualitative
                 research method, but few papers have encapsulated the
                 benefits, limits, and basic tenets of doing GT research on
                 user and provider experiences of health care services. GT can
                 be used to guide the entire study method, or it can be applied
                 at the data analysis stage only. METHODS: We summarize key
                 components of GT and common GT procedures used by qualitative
                 researchers in health care research. We draw on our experience
                 of conducting a GT study on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
                 patients' experiences of health care services. FINDINGS: We
                 discuss why some approaches in GT research may work better
                 than others, particularly when the focus of study is
                 hard-to-reach population groups. We highlight the flexibility
                 of procedures in GT to build theory about how people engage
                 with health care services. CONCLUSION: GT enables researchers
                 to capture and understand health care experiences. GT methods
                 are particularly valuable when the topic of interest has not
                 previously been studied. GT can be applied to bring structure

  abstract  = "Grounded Theory (GT) researchers have an ever-expanding palette
               of digital tools available to further analyse complex phenomena
               with interrelated data sets. However, few GT researchers have

               identified for their potential improvements to the analytical
               process, the research focuses on the experience of employing
               three diagramming tools (Flourish, Observable, and Pajek) in
               developing two complementary diagrams (Network and Arc

  author    = "Stehn, Lars and Jimenez, Alexander",
  abstract  = "Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand if and how
               industrialized house building (IHB) could support productivity
               developments for housebuilding on project and industry levels.
               The take is that fragmentation of construction is one
               explanation for the lack of productivity growth, and that IHB
               could be an integrating method of overcoming horizontal and
               vertical fragmentation. Design/methodology/approach Singe-factor
               productivity measures are calculated based on data reported by
               IHB companies and compared to official produced and published
               research data. The survey covers the years 2013--2020 for IHB
               companies building multi-storey houses in timber. Generalization
               is sought through descriptive statistics by contrasting the data
               samples to the used means to control vertical and horizontal
               fragmentation formulated as three theoretical propositions.
               Findings According to the results, IHB in timber is on average
               more productive than conventional housebuilding at the company
               level, project level, in absolute and in growth terms over the
               eight-year period. On the company level, the labour productivity
               was on average 10\% higher for IHB compared to general
               construction and positioned between general construction and
               general manufacturing. On the project level, IHB displayed an
               average cost productivity growth of 19\% for an employed
               prefabrication degree of about 45\%. Originality/value Empirical
               evidence is presented quantifying so far perceived advantages of
               IHB. By providing analysis of actual cost and project data
               derived from IHB companies, the article quantifies previous
               research that IHB is not only about prefabrication. The observed
               positive productivity growth in relation to the employed
               prefabrication degree indicates that off-site production is not
               a sufficient mean for reaching high productivity and
               productivity growth. Instead, the capabilities to integrate the
               operative logic of conventional housebuilding together with
               logic of IHB platform development and use is a probable
               explanation of the observed positive productivity growth.",

                     predominantly traditional, site-based, construction
                     methods. Recently, the house-building industry has found
                     itself under increasing pressure to raise production
                     output to alleviate a shortage in housing supply and
                     reduce house price inflation. Within this setting, there
                     has been much interest in the potential offered by
                     off-site construction (OSC). The production strategies
                     employed by private house-building firms however, are a
                     direct response to their operational environment, and the
                     adoption of OSC would arguably alter the way that they
                     deliver their developments. Hence, there is a clear need
                     to understand the relationship between production strategy
                     and construction methods. Based on a case study of one of
                     the largest private house-building firms in the UK, the
                     potential impacts of OSC on current production strategies
                     have been explored. The results indicate that the adoption
                     of OSC approaches may alter the manner in which
                     house-building firms are able to manage their production
                     process, reducing their control and restricting the very
                     flexibility on which their own success relies. The
                     findings have implications for the housebuilding industry,
                     OSC manufacturers and construction research, given the
                     ongoing interest in OSC as a means to address the UK's

              deliberate and rigorous way, and consider potential pitfalls in
              conducting thematic analysis. Finally, we outline the

               various approaches to the study of sociology were taken as the

  abstract  = "[Pierre Bourdieu suggests that his concept of habitus should be
               seen as a method; a way of thinking about the social world which
               invites an understanding of everyday practices as constitutive
               of social differences. The appeal of habitus lies in its ability
               to uncover social inequalities in a way that keeps agency and
               structure simultaneously in focus. However, there are also
               problems in operationalising habitus, chiefly because of the
               indeterminacy of the concept. In order to overcome these
               difficulties I have outlined four key components of habitus and
               attempted to delineate the aspects of habitus as method that
               seem most relevant to primary classrooms. Finally, drawing on
               ethnographic data gathered over 15 months of participant
               observation in two primary classrooms, the article seeks to
               explore through the lens of habitus how differences of gender,
               'race' and class are produced by children in primary classrooms.
               Although I make no claims for my own empirical work it does
               suggest that habitus as method has the potential to reveal the
               taken-for-granted inequalities embedded in everyday practices.]",

               have occupied the academic literature for decades. Those arguing
               in favor plead for greater rigor and clarity to determine ``what
               works.'' Those arguing against protest that education is a
               complex, social endeavor and that for epistemological,
               theoretical and political reasons it is not possible to state,
               with any useful degree of generalizable certainty, ``what
               works.'' While academics argue, policy and practice in Higher
               Education are beset with problems. Ineffective methods such as
               ``Learning Styles'' persist. Teaching quality and teacher
               performance are measured using subjective and potentially biased
               feedback. University educators have limited access to
               professional development, particularly for practical teaching
               skills. There is a huge volume of higher education research, but
               it is disconnected from educational practice. Change is needed.
               We propose a pragmatic model of Evidence-Based Higher Education,
               empowering educators and others to make judgements about the
               application of the most useful evidence, in a particular
               context, including pragmatic considerations of cost and other
               resources. Implications of the model include a need to emphasize
               pragmatic approaches to research in higher education, delivering
               results that are more obviously useful, and a pragmatic focus on
               practical teaching skills for the development of educators in
               Higher Education.",

               development in MBA programmes for the benefit of both marketing
               practitioners and academics.Design/methodology/approachThe
               research design/methodology is based primarily on survey
               research on skill development in MBA programmes from the
               perspectives of both graduates and marketing

               skill weaknesses -- decision making, leadership, problem
               formulation, persuasion, creativity, and negotiation -- need to
               be developed among future marketers and that a marketing

               skills needed for a position and then evaluating whether their
               personnel have these skills or if there is a ``skills gap''. The
               skills gap is the distance between the position requirements and
               the skills currently possessed by the worker in that position.
               While multiple models have been created over the years to
               address facets of the problem, none of them provide a
               comprehensive framework to clearly identify the required skills
               and worker qualifications and then evaluate the degree of
               similarity. A composite skills gap model has been developed
               using the Design Science Research Method to combine elements of
               previous models and to ensure that the resulting model met a set
               of established criteria. The Skills Gap Analysis Model (SGAM)
               was evaluated using demonstration data to ensure that it
               provided a single taxonomy for both position requirements and
               the worker qualifications, the resulting descriptions were
               quantifiable and comparable, the data was accurate and
               actionable, the model framework is adaptable to any domain, and
               that it is easy to use and not time consuming. The framework
               provided by the model establishes a theoretical foundation for
               skills gap analyses that allows for more analytical research in
               this area. By utilizing the SGAM to identify position
               requirements and worker qualifications, organizations can move
               personnel to better suited positions or utilize needed training
               in the specific areas identified. As technology moves towards
               increasing automation, robotics and artificial intelligence,

               the distance between the position requirements and the skills
               currently possessed by the worker in that position. While
               multiple models have been created over the years to address
               facets of the problem, none of them provide a comprehensive
               framework to clearly identify the required skills and worker
               qualifications and then evaluate the degree of similarity. A
               composite skills gap model has been developed using the design
               science research method (DSRM) to combine elements of previous
               models and to ensure that the resulting model met a set of
               established criteria. The skills gap analysis model (SGAM) was
               evaluated using demonstration data to ensure that it provided a
               single taxonomy, for both position requirements and the worker
               qualifications, the resulting descriptions were quantifiable and
               comparable, the data was accurate and actionable, the model
               framework is adaptable to any domain, and it is easy to use and
               not time consuming. The framework provided by the SGAM model
               establishes a theoretical foundation for skills gap analyses
               that allows for more analytical research in this area. By
               utilizing the SGAM to identify position requirements and worker
               qualifications, organizations can move personnel to
               better-suited positions or utilize needed training in the
               specific areas identified. As technology moves toward increasing
               automation, robotics and artificial intelligence, this type of
               model can identify what skills are necessary for ``retooling''
               the workforce to meet the needs to support these systems.",

  abstract  = "PurposePrime contractors spend up to 90 per cent of a
               construction project's turnover on buying goods and services,
               and thus suppliers have a large impact on project performance.
               Therefore, the purchasing function management of the prime
               contractor has a large influence on the overall performance: the
               more developed (i.e. mature or professional) this function is,
               the greater its positive contribution. The purpose of this paper
               is to develop and test a quick scan purchasing maturity tool by
               applying a design science research
               method.Design/methodology/approachThe maturity tool is developed
               by applying Hevner's framework for design science research. In
               this framework, foundations drawn from the available knowledge
               base are used to develop the new tool. Scientific justification
               of this new tool and approval of its approach for construction
               practice is obtained through testing it in the specific context
               of a case company.FindingsThe tool provides a company with
               insight into its current level of purchasing maturity and
               possibilities for improving performance by increasing this
               level.Originality/valueThe conciseness and the limited time

  abstract = "Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumptions,
              beliefs, and judgments, and thinking carefully and critically
              about how these influence the research process. The practice of
              reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as researchers and
              how this guides our research. It is central in debates on
              objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations of social
              science research and generated knowledge. Incorporating
              reflexivity in the research process is traditionally recognized
              as one of the most notable differences between qualitative and
              quantitative methodologies. Qualitative research centres and
              celebrates participants' lived experience, and qualitative
              researchers are readily encouraged to consider how their own
              positionalities inform the research process, forming an important
              part of qualitative research training. Quantitative methodologies
              in social and personality psychology, on the other hand, have
              remained seemingly detached from this level of reflexivity and
              general reflective practises. In this commentary, we, three
              quantitative researchers who have grappled with the compatibility
              of reflexivity with our research, argue that reflexivity has much
              to offer quantitative methodologists, in social and personality
              psychology and beyond. The act of reflexivity prompts researchers
              to acknowledge and centre their positionalities, encourages a
              more thoughtful engagement with every step of the research
              process, and thus, as we argue, contributes to the ongoing
              reappraisal of openness and transparency in psychology. In this
              paper, we make the case for integrating reflexivity across all
              research approaches, before providing a `beginner's guide' for
              quantitative researchers wishing to engage reflexivity within
              their work, providing concrete recommendations, worked examples,
              and reflexivity prompts.",

  abstract    = "The use of theory in science is an ongoing debate in the
                 production of knowledge. Related to qualitative research
                 methods, a variety of approaches have been set forth in the
                 literature using the terms conceptual framework, theoretical
                 framework, paradigm, and epistemology. While these approaches
                 are helpful in their own context, we summarize and distill
                 them in order to build upon the case that a balanced and
                 centered use of the theoretical framework can bolster the
                 qualitative approach. Our project builds on the arguments that
                 epistemology and methodological rigor are essential by adding
                 the notion that the influence of theory permeates almost every
                 aspect of the study---even if the author does not recognize
                 this influence. Compilers of methodological approaches have
                 referred to the use of theory as analogous to a coat closet in
                 which different items can be housed or a lens through which
                 the literature and data in the study are viewed. In this
                 article, we offer an evaluative quadrant for determining the
                 appropriate use of theory in qualitative research and a
                 diagram of the qualitative project that points to the central
                 role of a theoretical framework. We also caution against the
                 overreliance on theory in the event that it begins to limit
                 the ability to see emergent findings in the data.",

                 improve the teaching methods about construction robotics
                 through the presentation of a novel method called ``Imagine
                 and Make'', in which students learn how to integrate robotics
                 in different aspects and practices in construction projects.
                 The method has been applied at Centrale Lille in France since
                 2018. The results of the application of ``Imagine and Make''
                 in the first semester of 2021-2022, evaluation by students,
                 and teaching outcomes are reported in this paper.",

              ``Participatory Qualitative Research.'' In recent years there has
              been a resurgence of interest in participatory research
              strategies. The articles in this special issue come from
              different disciplines. Against the background of concrete
              empirical research projects, they address numerous conceptual
              considerations and methodological approaches. After reading the
              contributions, and engaging with the authors' arguments, we were
              prompted to focus in particular on those areas in which further
              work needs to be done. They include, on the one hand, fundamental
              principles of participatory research, such as democratic-theory
              considerations, the concept of ``safe space,'' participation
              issues, and ethical questions. And, on the other hand, we focus
              on practical research considerations regarding the role and tasks
              of the various participants; specific methodological approaches;
              and quality criteria---understood here in the sense of arguments
              justifying a participatory approach. Our aim is to stimulate a
              broad discussion that does not focus only on participatory
              research in the narrower sense. Because participatory methodology
              poses certain knowledge- and research-related questions in a
              radical way, it has the potential to draw attention to hitherto
              neglected areas in qualitative methodology and to stimulate their

  abstract = "In this paper I shall present and develop my organisational
              language, social activity method (SAM), and illustrate some of
              its applications. I shall introduce a new scheme for modes of
              recontextualisation that enables the analysis of the ways in
              which one activity -- which might be school mathematics or social
              research or any empirically observed regularity of practice --
              recontextualises the practice of another and I shall also
              present, deploy, and develop an existing scheme -- domains of
              action -- in an analysis of school mathematics examination papers
              and in the structuring of what I refer to as the esoteric domain.
              This domain is here conceived as a hybrid domain of, first,
              linguistic and extralinguistic resources that are unambiguously
              mathematical in terms of both expression and content and, second,
              pedagogic theory -- often tacit -- that enables the mathematical
              gaze onto other practices and so recontextualises them. A second
              and more general theme that runs through the paper is the claim
              that there is nothing that is beyond semiosis, that there is
              nothing to which we have direct access, unmediated by
              interpretation. This state of affairs has implications for
              mathematics education. Specifically, insofar as an individual's
              mathematical semiotic system is under continuous development --
              the curriculum never being graspable all at once -- understanding
              -- as a stable semiotic moment -- of any aspect or object of
              mathematics is always localised to the individual and is at best
              transient, and the sequencing of such moments may well also be
              more individualised than consistent in some correspondence with
              the sequencing of the curriculum. This being the case, a
              concentration on understanding as a goal may well serve to
              inhibit the pragmatic acquisition and deployment of mathematical
              technologies, which should be the principal aim of mathematics
              teaching and learning. The paper is primarily concerned with
              mathematics education. SAM, however, is a language that is
              available for recruiting and deploying in potentially any context
              as I have attempted to illustrate with some of the secondary

  abstract    = "BACKGROUND: According to Dweck and colleagues, praise can be
                 delivered using person ('you are clever') or process terms
                 ('you worked hard'). Research suggests that giving people
                 process praise after success can help them deal better with
                 subsequent failures because it attributes outcomes to effort
                 rather than fixed ability. However, research has thus far
                 inadequately addressed how these types of praise compare to
                 receiving no evaluative feedback. AIM: The aim of the present
                 research was to examine the effects of person and process
                 praise compared to a control group where only objective
                 outcome feedback was given. SAMPLES: In Study 1, 145 British
                 school children aged 9-11 years took part. In Study 2,
                 participants were 114 British university students. METHOD: In
                 both studies, participants read three scenarios and were asked
                 to imagine themselves as the main character. In each scenario,
                 they succeeded in an educational task and received either
                 person, process, or no praise. Participants then read two
                 scenarios, where they failed at a task. Following each
                 scenario participants evaluated their performance, affect, and
                 persistence. RESULTS: After one failure, participants who
                 received person praise reacted most negatively on all
                 dependent measures. However, those in the process condition
                 did not differ significantly from those in the control group.
                 CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that process feedback may
                 not be inherently positive; instead person feedback seems
                 particularly detrimental.",

  abstract  = "Purpose -- The purpose of this paper is to investigate the
               current skills gap in both generic and skill areas within the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia.
               Design/methodology/approach -- An internet-based survey was
               administered to collect the opinions of construction employees
               about the workplace-training environment and their perceptions
               towards training. The survey intended to address the following
               research questions, specifically in relation to the construction
               industry. Findings -- The survey results reveal that whilst
               overall participation in workplace training is high, the current
               workplace training environments do not foster balanced skill
               development. The study reveals that in the current absence of a
               formal and well-balanced training mechanism, construction
               workers generally resort to their own informal self-development
               initiatives to develop the needed role-specific theoretical
               knowledge. Research limitations/implications -- The findings of
               the research are based on the data primarily collected in the
               construction industry in Queensland, Australia. The data are
               limited to a single Tier 2 construction company. Practical
               implications -- The findings of this study can be utilised to
               suggest improvements in the current (or develop new) workplace
               training initiatives. Social implications -- The research
               suggests that workplace training has positive relationship with
               career growth. The results suggest that in the construction
               industry, employees are generally well aware of the importance
               of workplace training in their career development and they
               largely appreciate training as being a critical factor for
               developing their capacity to perform their roles successfully,
               and to maintain their employability. Originality/value -- This
               paper is unique as it investigates the current skills gap in
               both generic and skill areas within the construction industry in
               Queensland, Australia. So far no work has been undertaken to
               identify and discusses the main method of workplace learning
               within the Tier 2 industry in the context of Queensland
               Australia.",

               of four different strategies for teaching three to four year old
               children how to master a difficult construction task. These
               strategies were derived from previous studies of mother-child
               and experimenter-child interactions in an assisted learning
               situation. One strategy the 'contingent approach' was based
               primarily on theoretical considerations and when used in earlier
               work as a basis for describing and evaluating maternal teaching
               it enabled us to predict how well children taught by their
               mothers would do with a task after instruction. The three other
               strategies are idealised versions of the teaching methods used
               by less successful mothers-as-teachers. On the basis of our
               analysis of effective instruction it is possible to predict how
               well children taught by these four different techniques by a
               trained instructor should perform after instruction.The present
               study largely confirms these predictions. In so doing, it
               strengthens the supposition that it was maternal behaviour in
               the earlier work which influenced the children's task abilities
               and it also corroborates various hypotheses about the essential
               nature of effective face-to-face instruction.",

               a virtual reality driving simulator capable of conveying haptic
               and visual messages to promote eco-sustainable driving behavior.
               The driving simulator was implemented through the Unity game
               engine; a large street environment, including high-speed and
               urban sections, was created to examine different driving
               behaviors. The hardware setup included a gaming driving seat,
               equipped with a steering wheel and pedals; the virtual scenarios
               were displayed through an Oculus Rift headset to guarantee an
               immersive experience. Haptic stimulation (i.e., vibrations) was
               delivered to the driver through the accelerator pedal, while
               visual stimuli (i.e., icons and colors) were shown on a virtual
               head-up display. The sensory feedbacks were presented both alone
               and in combination, providing information about excessive
               acceleration and speed. Four different virtual scenarios, each
               one including a distracting element (i.e., navigator, rain,
               call, and traffic), were also created. Ten participants tested
               the simulator. Fuel consumption was evaluated by calculating a
               mean power index (MPI) in reference to the sensory feedback
               presentation; physiological reactions and responses to a
               usability survey were also collected. The results revealed that
               the haptic and visuo-haptic feedback were responsible for an MPI
               reduction, respectively, for 14\% and 11\% compared with a
               condition of no feedback presentation; while visual feedback
               alone resulted in an MPI increase of 11\%. The efficacy of
               haptic feedback was also accompanied by a more relaxing
               physiological state of the users, compared with the visual
               stimulation. The system's usability was adequate, although
               haptic stimuli were rated slightly more intrusive than the
               visual ones. Overall, these preliminary results highlight how
               promising the use of the haptic channel can be in communicating
               and guiding the driver toward a more eco-sustainable behavior.",

  title    = "Aligning the real and the virtual world: Mixed reality
              localisation using learning-based {3D--3D} model registration",
  author   = "Radanovic, Marko and Khoshelham, Kourosh and Fraser, Clive",
  abstract = "Existing camera localisation methods for indoor augmented and
              mixed reality (AR/MR) are almost exclusively image based. The
              main issue with image-based methods is that they do not scale
              well and, as a consequence, AR/MR applications are mostly limited
              to small-scale room experiences. To tackle the challenge of
              large-scale indoor AR/MR localisation, we propose a novel
              framework for AR/MR localisation based solely on 3D--3D model
              registration. The localisation is performed by an automated
              registration of a low-density model of the surroundings created
              by the device to the existing point cloud of the environment
              based on learning-based keypoint detection and description. Our
              solution takes advantage of recent significant improvements in
              automated coarse-to-fine 3D--3D model registration methods.
              Unlike the existing image-based AR/MR localisation methods, which
              are restricted to small room-sized environments, the proposed 3D
              registration-based approach is applicable to large environments
              and is robust to changes in colour and illumination of the scene.
              We perform extensive testing and analysis of the approach with
              real-world experiments and datasets using a prototype developed
              for the Microsoft HoloLens. Experimental results show high
              localisation reliability and accuracy, with a mean translation
              error of 2.8 cm and a mean rotation error of 0.30°. The method
              performs well in a large-scale environment (300 m2) and shows
              good robustness to changes in scene geometry.",

               buzzword amid the global resurgence of prefabrication and
               construction industrialization. Some argued that DfMA is hardly
               new, as there are concepts such as buildability, lean
               construction, value management, and integrated project delivery
               in place already. Others believe that DfMA is a new direction to
               future construction. This paper aims to review the development
               of DfMA in manufacturing and its status quo in construction, and
               clarify its similarities and differences to other concepts. A
               multi-step research method is adopted in this study: First, an
               analytical framework is generated; Secondly, a literature review
               is conducted on DfMA in general, and DfMA-like concepts in the
               AEC industry; The third step is to compare DfMA with related
               concepts. This study reveals that DfMA as a philosophy is hardly
               new in construction, and the empirical implementation of many
               DfMA guidelines has begun in the AEC industry. The findings
               suggested that DfMA is a new and mixed ?cocktail? of

               This paper seeks to cover a comprehensive review with case

              is considered to play an important role in helping manufacturing
              companies stay competitive in the international market. However,
              despite the achievements made in the field of VR, it is still an
              emerging technology that lacks deeper exploration and development
              in industrial application scenarios, especially in the coming
              fourth industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). This paper aims to
              systematically investigate the applications of VR in industrial
              maintenance to discover evidence of its values, limitations, and
              future directions so that VR can be guided to better serve
              manufacturing enterprises in remaining competitive in the coming
              Industry 4.0. A systematic literature review (SLR) methodology is
              adopted to review primary studies on this topic, by which 86
              studies are ultimately included. The results show that VR has
              proved its value in benefiting maintenance issues through the
              product lifecycle. However, VR is still not an indispensable
              element for the lifecycle management of products regarding
              maintenance-related issues. Several key findings are concluded
              based on the analysis of the 86 studies. This review is valuable

              small and medium-size architectural and construction practices
              with a limited budget and time dedicated to visualisation

               the performance of construction project delivery. While the
               construction industry is often labeled as conservative and
               unimaginative with regard to technology adoption, significant
               strides have been made in recent years  specifically, the use
               of Building Information Modeling (BIM) for information storage,
               distribution and communication, as well as Lean construction
               techniques such as production planning and control (PPC). While
               the implementation of these innovative technologies and
               practices individually improve project performance, integrating
               them together can provide still greater benefits. BIM is
               certainly useful, but it alone is not a satisfactory answer to
               the paradox: how does one design and visualize a 3D product in a
               2D space? Augmented Reality (AR) is a disruptive technology that
               can help address this challenge. AR is both an aggregator of
               information and an information publishing platform which allows
               users a spectrum of capabilities to 1) passively view displayed
               information, 2) actively engage and interact with published
               content, and 3) collaborate with others in real time from remote
               locations. No extant research effort has comprehensively
               investigated the opportunities and benefits of the integrated
               use of AR, BIM, and Lean in the planning process to improve
               project performance. This paper addresses precisely this
               research gap. Using insights gained from real-world construction
               projects, this paper examines the current state of production
               strategy process (PSP) development  an integral part of PPC,
               identifies pain-points and opportunities for process

               representational analysis for the study of distributed cognitive
               tasks---tasks that require the processing of information
               distributed across the internal mind and the external
               environment. The basic principle of distributed representations
               Is that the representational system of a distributed cognitive
               task is a set of internal and external representations, which
               together represent the abstract structure of the task. The basic
               strategy of representational analysis is to decompose the
               representation of a hierarchical task into its component levels
               so that the representational properties at each level can be
               independently examined. The theoretical framework and the
               methodology are used to analyze the hierarchical structure of
               the Tower of Hanoi problem. Based on this analysis, four
               experiments are designed to examine the representational
               properties of the Tower of Hanoi. Finally, the nature of

  abstract  = "AbstractAmidst concerns over skills shortages, both the current
               British government and its coalition predecessors have, against
               the grain of wider austerity measures, invested heavily in the
               apprenticeship system. The majority of apprentices are, and have
               historically been, employed within small businesses. However,
               research suggests that, in the main, small firms tend to
               approach management issues ? including workplace employee
               development ? in a less formal way than their larger
               counterparts. What implications this has for apprentices and
               their workplace learning remains unclear. The article aims to
               address this gap, and it does so through a qualitative study of
               apprentices in three English engineering firms of different
               sizes. The findings broadly support the established picture of
               informal working and learning processes in the small firm.
               However, it is argued that this does not inevitably restrict
               apprentices? on-the-job learning. Rather, the ways in which
               apprentices learn, and what they learn, are conditioned by the
               interaction ? or ?co-participation? ? between the opportunities
               afforded by the workplace, and the apprentice?s subjective
               agency.",

  abstract  = "ABSTRACTThis article explores change possibilities towards
               status improvement in vocational education?s social
               construction. Following other researchers, it assumes that
               higher-status vocational education should give vocational
               learners perspectives that would accord with their identities
               and desires, broadly ranging between working in a particular
               company and further studies. The article proposes that change in
               this direction must concern the
               transmitter-acquirer-knowledge-relation and also curriculum,
               evaluation and the external relations of education. To think
               systematically about changes of these ?adjusting screws?, this
               article proposes a realist approach with Bernstein?s conceptual
               language, and Moore's Bernstein-based model of education where
               vocational learners, plausibly, receive an orientation towards
               broad futures beyond narrow job roles. Moore's model implies
               fundamental changes of all these ?adjusting screws? and,
               importantly, of the principle underlying their realisation in
               schools. The case of company-based education in Germany?s ?dual
               system? is advanced as a real-life example for the highly
               theoretical model. Findings from a Bernsteinian analysis of the
               transmitter-acquirer-relation in regulated company transmission
               made sense, when the system was understood as realising the
               principles envisioned in Moore?s model. The model and its
               underlying principles, together with their realisation in the
               DS, open up a perspective towards education (instead of job
               training) in workplaces.",

               describe WPL processes and outcomes in the Dutch senior VET

               various factors in the different dimensions of learning

               Such a climate actively militates against collective learning

               only limited attention. Our study explores employers?
               experiences in organizing internships, and their collaboration

               that employers want to raise within the collaborative framework
               require attention. These themes include relations with students,

                 the effectiveness of MDT, through the use of activity theory
                 (collective work activity shared by others who are motivated
                 by a purpose mediated by tools in order to achieve a specific
                 goal) and the associated idea of knotworking (method of tying,
                 untying, and retying together seemingly separate threads of
                 activity). The leading thesis here is that MDTs benefit from
                 health professionals with well-established leadership skills,
                 and also strong collaborative skills that enable them to
                 transition fluidly between leadership roles as needed to
                 advance patient care. Within activity theory, knotworking is
                 the process of tying and untying various threads of activity
                 and knowledge from across the MDT in order to accomplish
                 specific objectives over time. Knotworking exemplifies the
                 dynamic nature of MDT collaboration, which requires
                 professionals to be productive in their environment. The
                 viewpoints offered in this editorial contribute to a new

  abstract  = "PurposeApprenticeship programmes are designed to provide young
               trainees with essential broad-based skills. Through
               apprenticeships, different sectors that are underpopulated can
               fill up their skills gaps. Apprenticeships are particularly
               useful to the construction sector which has a high ageing
               workforce and associated lower labour productivity. However, the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training programmes in the
               construction sector remain low in several countries across the
               globe. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to review the
               published research on apprenticeship training that is
               specifically focused on the construction sector, to determine
               the current status quo and suggest a direction for future
               research.Design/methodology/approachA systematic review approach
               was adopted. Based on a comprehensive search using SCOPUS
               databases, 33 relevant journal articles were identified and
               analysed.FindingsIt was found that monitoring and control is the
               most mentioned factor responsible for improvements in the
               completion rates of apprenticeship training. In contrast, the
               length of time required for going through the full training is
               the most common factor responsible for low completion rates.
               Three research gaps were identified, among which is the dearth
               of studies that has focused on apprentices training in
               developing countries.Research limitations/implicationsThe gaps
               identified in the current knowledge on apprenticeship training
               would serve as a justification for future investigations.
               However, the scope of the review is limited to papers published
               in academic journals and citable through SCOPUS.Practical
               implicationsThe outcomes of the study provide researchers and
               other relevant stakeholders with a concise report on the
               findings of previous studies. It also provides insight into
               strategies for improving the completion rates of apprenticeship
               training in the construction sector.Originality/valueA
               systematic evaluation of the extant literature draws on
               theoretical evidence and highlights the factors that are more
               likely to influence the outcomes of apprentice training for
               craftspeople in the construction sector.",

@ARTICLE{Nerland2021-cp,
  title       = "Challenging the Belief in Simple Solutions: the Need for
                 Epistemic Practices in Professional Work",
  author      = "Nerland, Monika and Hasu, Mervi",
  affiliation = "Department of Education, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway.",
  abstract    = "CONTEXT: As a contribution to the State of the Science issue
                 on 'The problem with solutions', this paper discusses how
                 technology-mediated and assumedly simple and straightforward
                 solutions to professional problems in fact require extensive
                 work from professionals in order that generalised tools and
                 procedures can be made sense of, adapted and employed in local
                 practice. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVE: The authors introduce a
                 perspective on epistemic practices in professional work and
                 learning in order to conceptualise and discuss the diversity
                 of the knowledge-related actions required to perform
                 professional services. They discuss how the growing numbers
                 and diversity of knowledge-generating actors who aspire to
                 inform professional practice create 'multi-charged' work
                 settings, imbued with multiple objectives and purposes. This
                 development presents new epistemic challenges to
                 professionals, which require extended capacities for knowledge
                 work. SUMMARY: The authors give examples from empirical
                 studies conducted in Nordic health care settings, which relate
                 to nurses' engagement with repositories of clinical procedures
                 and to the development of new medical technologies for
                 clinical use. They show how work performance in both cases
                 depends on a range of epistemic practices (ie, collective ways
                 of exploring, assessing, critically examining and justifying
                 knowledge claims), which are necessary if the general tools
                 and technologies are to be put to work in the local
                 environment. This forms a core dynamic in practitioners'
                 work-based learning as it moves between what is known and what
                 remains to be explored or improved. CONCLUSIONS: The paper
                 argues that the widespread belief in simple or versatile
                 solutions is challenged by research that reveals the diversity
                 of the knowledge practices needed to perform professional
                 services. The paper suggests that professional communities
                 might pay more attention to epistemic practices as means to
                 handle complexity. It raises intriguing questions and
                 discusses implications for medical education.",

               offers an in-depth guide to the theories, practices, and
               policies of vocational education and training (VET). With
               contributions from a panel of leading international scholars,
               the Handbook contains 27 authoritative essays from a wide range
               of disciplines. The contributors present an integrated analysis
               of the complex and dynamic field of VET. Drawing on the most
               recent research, thinking, and practice in the field, the book
               explores the key debates about the role of VET in the education
               and training systems of various nations. The Handbook reveals
               how expertise is developed in an age of considerable
               transformation in work processes, work organization, and
               occupational identities. The authors also examine many of the
               challenges of vocational education and training such as the
               impact of digital technologies on employment, the demand for
               (re)training in the context of extended working lives, the
               emergence of learning regions and skill ecosystems, and the
               professional development of vocational teachers and trainers.

               Knowing in Different Productive Systems",
  author    = "Fuller, Alison and Unwin, Lorna and Bishop, Dan and Felstead,
               Alan and Jewson, Nick and Konstantinos, Kakavelakis and Lee,
               Tracey",
  abstract  = "This paper explores the relationship between the way work is
               organised, the organisational context, and learning in the
               workplace. It develops, in part, from earlier work where we
               argued that organisations differ in the way they create and
               manage themselves as learning environments, with some
               conceptualised as expansive in the sense that their employees
               experience diverse forms of participation and, hence, are more
               likely to foster learning at work (see Fuller and Unwin, 2004).
               The paper argues that contemporary workplaces give rise to many
               different forms of learning, some of which is utilised to the
               benefit of the organisation and employees (though not,
               necessarily, in a reciprocal manner), but much of which is
               buried within everyday workplace activity. By studying the way
               in which work is organised (including the organisation of
               physical and virtual spaces), it is possible to expose some of
               this learning activity as well as examples of the creation of
               new (or refined) knowledge. Part of this process involves the
               breaking down of conceptual hierarchies that presuppose that
               learning is restricted to certain types of employee and/or parts
               of an organisation. This paper builds on the work of other
               researchers who highlight the importance of the context (see,
               inter alia, Nonaka et al, 2005; Boreham and Morgan, 2004; Unwin
               et al 2005). It also draws on the work of Engestrom (see, inter
               alia, 2001), who has highlighted the way new knowledge is
               created through employee interaction when problem solving and,
               hence, has paid attention to the important question of the
               quality of learning in the workplace. In addition, it builds on
               Wilkinsons (2002) conceptualisation of the way organisations
               construct, manage and respond to social relations of production
               that operate at a variety of levels in productive systems. The
               paper uses evidence from the learning as work project, which is
               based in public and private sector organisations in the UK.",
