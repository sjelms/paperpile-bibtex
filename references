               intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs). Many of those systems have
               tackled fundamental subjects such as mathematics, physics, and
               computer programming. The change of the student's cognitive
               behavior over time, however, has not been considered and modeled
               systematically. Furthermore, the nature of domain knowledge in
               specific subjects such as orthopedic surgery, in which pragmatic
               knowledge could play an important role, has also not been taken
               into account deliberately. We believe that the temporal
               dimension in modeling the student's knowledge state and
               cognitive behavior is critical, especially in such domains. In
               this paper, we propose an approach for student modeling and
               diagnosis, which is based on a symbiosis between temporal
               Bayesian networks and fine-grained didactic analysis. The latter
               may help building a powerful domain knowledge model and the
               former may help modeling the learner's complex cognitive
               behavior, so as to be able to provide him or her with relevant
               feedback during a problem-solving process. To illustrate the
               application of the approach, we designed and developed several
               key components of an intelligent learning environment for
               teaching the concept of sacro-iliac screw fixation in orthopedic
               surgery, for which we videotaped and analyzed six surgical
               interventions in a French hospital. A preliminary gold-standard
               validation suggests that our diagnosis component is able to
               produce coherent diagnosis with acceptable response time.",

               systems that are founded on the assumption that learning based
               on individualized instruction by a competent tutor is far
               superior to classroom-style group instruction. Good human tutors
               are `intelligent tutors' because they are able to continously
               adapt the content and style of their instruction to best meet
               the needs of the learner. The historical evolution of
               intelligent tutoring systems is presented. The starting point
               was programmed instruction in the late 1960s, followed by
               knowledge-based tutors that try to simulate good human tutors by
               the integrated use of domain knowledge, teaching knowledge, and
               knowledge about the individual student. Finally some important
               current trends like distance learning, collaborative learning,
               and Web-based learning are outlined. The presentation is given
               within a cognitive science point of view. From this perspective

               tutor-centered one, a student-centered one, and an interactive
               one could all potentially explain the effectiveness of tutoring.
               To test these hypotheses, analyses focused not only on the
               effectiveness of the tutors' moves, but also on the
               effectiveness of the students' construction on learning, as well
               as their interaction. The interaction hypothesis is further
               tested in the second study by manipulating the kind of tutoring
               tactics tutors were permitted to use. In order to promote a more
               interactive style of dialogue, rather than a didactic style,
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Instead, tutors were encouraged to prompt the students.
               Surprisingly, students learned just as effectively even when
               tutors were suppressed from giving explanations and feedback.
               Their learning in the interactive style of tutoring is
               attributed to construction from deeper and a greater amount of

               Systems (ITSs) tailors direction, support, and feedback to
               enhance/maintain the learning needs (e.g., lack of knowledge or
               skill) of each individual. Today, ITSs are generally developed
               to support desktop training applications, with the most common
               domains involving cognitive problem solving tasks (e.g.,
               mathematics and physics). In recent years, implementations of
               game-based tutors authored using the Generalized Intelligent
               Framework for Tutoring (GIFT), an open-source tutoring
               architecture, provided tailored training experiences for
               military tasks through desktop applications (e.g., games
               including Virtual Battlespace and Virtual Medic). However, these
               game-based desktop tutors have also been limited to adaptive
               instruction for cognitive tasks (e.g., problem solving and
               decision-making). The military requires adaptive instruction to
               extend beyond the desktop to be compatible with the physical
               nature of many tasks performed by soldiers, sailors, and airmen.
               This article examines how commercial sensor technologies might
               be adapted to work with GIFT and support tailored
               computer-guided instruction in the psychomotor domain for a
               military medical training task, specifically hemorrhage control.
               Toward this goal, we evaluated the usability and system features
               of commercial smart glasses and pressure-sensing technologies.
               Smart glasses were selected as the focus of this study over
               handheld mobile devices in order to promote a hands-free
               experience during the training of hemorrhage-control tasks on a
               mannequin. Pressure sensors were selected to provide direct
               measures of effectiveness during the application of tourniquets
               and pressure bandages. Each set of technologies (smart glasses
               and pressure sensors) was evaluated not with respect to each
               other, but with respect to their capabilities to support
               adaptive instruction in the wild at the learner?s point-of-need
               and criteria based on established usability heuristics.
               Instruction in the wild is training provided in an environment
               outside the classroom and areas where tracking and sensing
               infrastructure are available (e.g., deployed areas of
               operation). We examined a wide range of features and
               capabilities, and evaluated their compatibility with the
               hemorrhage-control task, to answer the following question: what
               system design features (e.g., usability and interaction) are
               needed to support adaptive instruction for this individual
               psychomotor task at the point-of-need in locations where no
               formal training infrastructure is available?",

              the majority of existing buildings is not maintained, refurbished

              resource management motivate research to overcome uncertainties
              of building condition and deficient documentation prevalent in
              existing buildings. Due to rapid developments in BIM research,
              involved stakeholders demand a state-of-the-art overview of BIM
              implementation and research in existing buildings. This paper
              presents a review of over 180 recent publications on the topic.
              Results show scarce BIM implementation in existing buildings yet,
              due to challenges of (1) high modeling/conversion effort from
              captured building data into semantic BIM objects, (2) updating of
              information in BIM and (3) handling of uncertain data, objects
              and relations in BIM occurring in existing buildings. Despite
              fast developments and spreading standards, challenging research
              opportunities arise from process automation and BIM adaption to

              have typically been tied to its capability to support information
              structuring and exchange through the centralization of
              information. Its increasing adoption and the associated ease of
              data acquisition has created information intensive work
              environments, which can result in information overload and thus
              negatively impact workers task efficiency during construction.
              Augmented Reality (AR) has been proposed as a mechanism to
              enhance the process of information extraction from building
              information models to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
              workers' tasks. Yet, there is limited research that has evaluated
              the effectiveness and usability of AR in this domain. This
              research aims to address this gap and evaluate the effectiveness
              of BIM and AR system integration to enhance task efficiency
              through improving the information retrieval process during
              construction. To achieve this, a design science research approach
              was adopted that enabled the development and performance of a
              mobile BIM AR system (artefact) with cloud-based storage
              capabilities to be tested and evaluated using a portable desktop
              experiment. A total of 20 participants compared existing manual
              information retrieval methods (control group), with information
              retrieval through the artefact (non-control group). The results
              revealed that the participants using the artefact were
              approximately 50\% faster in completing their experiment tasks,
              and committed less errors, when compared to the control group.
              This research demonstrates that a minor modification to existing
              information formats (2D plans) with the inclusion of Quick
              Response markers can significantly improve the information

              started to affect our daily lives. AR applications are becoming
              mature and versatile. This paper discusses trends in AR
              applications for architecture, engineering, construction, and
              facility management (AEC/FM). This paper specifically focuses on
              four technologies---localization, natural user interface (NUI),
              cloud computing, and mobile devices---which have the potential to
              influence the development of AR applications. Advances in
              localization technology will enable the deployment of AR in a
              complex environment. An NUI provides more convenient and
              intuitive user experiences, which can increase the usability of
              AR. Cloud computing environments allow users with internet access
              to ubiquitously retrieve information from almost anywhere. Hence,
              cloud computing increases the freedom of using AR in AEC/FM
              applications. Another factor that will lead to the wider usage of
              AR is that mobile devices are becoming smaller, more powerful,
              and less expensive. This paper summarizes the results of 101

              One of these new methods is showing real time videos that

              lecture. The purpose of this paper is to use augmented reality
              technology (ART) and a layer of artificial visualizations to
              simulate the environmental context and spatio-temporal
              constraints of various construction processes. The
              superimposition of images serves as an instructional mechanism to
              virtually incorporate jobsite experiences into classrooms. This
              enhancement of spatio-temporal constraints enables learners to

              through traditional classroom lectures.
              Design/methodology/approach A significantly improved perception
              of reality is created through the combination of the learners'
              ability to understand the complexity of construction products

              many factors that are potentially dangerous to workers. Safety
              has always been advocated by many construction companies, and
              they have been working hard to make sure their employees are
              protected from fatalities and injuries. With the advent of
              Virtual and Augmented Reality (VR/AR), there has been a witnessed
              trend of capitalizing on sophisticated immersive VR/AR
              applications to create forgiving environments for visualizing
              complex workplace situations, building up risk-preventive

              state-of-the-art of VR/AR applications in construction safety
              (VR/AR-CS) and from which to uncover the related issues and

              and synthesis of research evidence for several VR/AR prototypes,
              products and the related training and evaluation paradigms.
              Predicated upon a wide range of well-acknowledged scholarly
              journals, this paper comes up with a generic taxonomy consisting
              of VR/AR technology characteristics, application domains, safety

  abstract = "Abstract Building Information Modeling (BIM) techniques have
              enabled the construction industry to realize various benefits.
              However, most projects still rely on 2D drawings to communicate
              the 3D BIM content to construction personnel. While Mixed Reality
              (MR) could theoretically be the primary means of communicating
              BIM content to onsite personnel in 3D, there is not currently a
              thorough understanding of how this might impact the construction
              performance of industry practitioners. This paper explores this
              topic by examining the field of electrical construction. It
              addresses research questions related to: MR's influence on the
              productivity and quality of electrical conduit construction; and
              the effects of an industry practitioner's background on his or
              her performance using MR. To address these topics, a
              quasi-experiment was conducted that compares the performance of
              eighteen electrical construction personnel who were tasked with
              building similar conduit assemblies using traditional paper and
              MR. Participants completed pre- and post-activity questionnaires
              to provide their perceptions of the experience. The results
              suggest that MR enabled: a significantly higher productivity
              rate; reduced the time required to understand the design; led to
              fewer errors during the assembly process; and increased the
              number of accurately constructed conduits as compared to the
              conduits constructed using traditional paper. Additionally,
              nearly all participants agreed that MR is easy to use, but most
              still felt that they would prefer to use paper plans for design
              communication. The findings of this work were noteworthy because
              many of the participants had substantial prior experience
              constructing conduit using paper plans, yet they still performed
              the task better and faster using MR. While the small sample size
              limits the extent to which these findings can be generalized, the
              contribution of this work is in demonstrating, as a
              proof-of-concept, that MR can be a viable option for
              communicating existing BIM content to current industry
              practitioners and that it can offer advantages that are not

               forms of perfection that men might seek. The first and lowest
               form is perfection in the acquisition of worldly goods. The
               great philosopher dismisses such perfection on the ground that
               the possessions one acquires bear no meaningful relation to the
               possessor: ``A great king may one morning find that there is no
               difference between him and the lowest person.'' A second
               perfection is of the body, its conformation and skills. Its
               failing is that is does not reflect on what is uniquely human
               about man: ``he could [in any case] not be as strong as a
               mule.'' Moral perfection is the third, ``the highest degree of
               excellency in man's character.'' Of this perfection Maimonides
               says: ``Imagine a person being alone, and having no connection
               whatever with any other person; all his good moral principles
               are at rest, they are not required and give man no perfection
               whatever. These principles are only necessary and useful when
               man comes in contact with others.'' ``The fourth kind of
               perfection is the true perfection of man; the possession of the
               highest intellectual faculties . . . .'' In justification of his
               assertion, this extraordinary Spanish-Judaic philosopher urges:
               ``Examine the first three kinds of perfection; you will find
               that if you possess them, they are not your property, but the
               property of others . . . . But the last kind of perfection is
               exclusively yours; no one else owns any part of it.''",

  abstract = "Purpose This paper aims to compare the performance of building
              trades apprenticeship programs in the USA, sponsored jointly by
              employers and unions, with those sponsored unilaterally by
              employers. It reviews enrolment and graduation rates, including
              participation of women and minorities. The article also looks
              behind the numbers to examine the operation of apprenticeship. It
              reviews the evolution of joint programs, including institutional
              arrangements and recent innovations to cope with the challenging
              characteristics of construction labor markets.
              Design/methodology/approach Statistical comparisons by type of
              program sponsor are carried out using individual‐level data on
              registered apprenticeship for the period 1996‐2003. Evolution of
              apprenticeship programs is discussed in a historical perspective.
              Findings Joint programs (with union participation) were found to
              have much higher enrolments and greater participation of women
              and ethnic/racial minorities. Joint programs also exhibit
              markedly better performance for all groups on rates of attrition
              and completion. Joint programs have developed various
              innovations, including college credit for training and
              scholarship loans to expand apprenticeship and improve quality
              and retention, although there are no quantitative evaluations of
              the effectiveness of many of these specific measures. Research
              limitations/implications Statistical information includes about
              65 percent of all registered apprentices in the USA. Practical
              implications The paper shows that alternative forms of training
              sponsorship have substantially different effects on enrolment and
              graduation. Identification of the practices, that improve
              enrolment and retention, and their widespread adoption would
              enhance the effectiveness of training programs. Originality/value

              new and more powerful type of computer-assisted instruction
              (CAI), based on extensive application of artificial-intelligence
              (AI) techniques, is feasible, and to demonstrate some of its
              major capabilities. A set of computer programs was written and
              given the name SCHOLAR. Due to its complexity, only the
              conception and educational aspects of this system (including an
              actual on-line protocol) are presented in this paper. In what may
              be called conventional ad hoc-frame-oriented (AFO) CAI, the data
              base consists of many ``frames'' of specific pieces of text,
              questions, and anticipated answers entered in advance by the
              teacher. By contrast, an information-structure-oriented (ISO) CAI
              system is based on the utilization of an information network of
              facts, concepts, and procedures; it can generate text, questions,
              and corresponding answers. Because an ISO CAI system can also
              utilize its information network to answer questions formulated by
              the student, a mixed-initiative dialogue between student and
              computer is possible with questions and answers from both sides.",

               with glimpses into the local cultures for which they are
               designing, and thereby inspire novel design proposals.
               HCI4D/ICTD researchers are increasingly interested in more
               deeply understanding local cultures in the developing regions
               where they work, in designing technologies that are not strictly
               related to socioeconomic development, and in considering new
               design approaches. However, few use this subjective, design-led

               also inspired a series of speculative design proposals. My
               experience motivates a discussion that elaborates on how a
               cultural probes approach can benefit HCI4D/ICTD research by
               raising questions about generalizability, objectivity, and the
               pursuit of a single solution in design. More broadly, I offer a

               done 'for', 'with' or 'by' the users based on the assumption

               component in mass-market production and are seen as 'customers',

               management and citizens from three different municipalities.

               thereby exercise influence on their own lives as well as their

               dispositional, and relational---that are each related to
               learning and development in work contexts. These perspectives do
               not reflect incompatible positions but rather different aspects
               of the same phenomena. The chapter also offers an avenue of
               insight into empirical studies that employ agency as a central
               concept as well as discussions about concepts that closely

  abstract  = "In the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) field,
               eye tracking technology is being applied more frequently in
               cognitive research such as hazard identification. These studies
               typically use eye tracking in a diagnostic way and pay less
               attention to the application of virtual environment. However, in
               virtual environment, eye tracking not only can enhance the study
               of the cognitive process but also improves the human-computer
               interaction. Therefore, this paper elaborates on how we use eye
               tracking devices to track 3D objects in virtual environments
               diagnostically and interactively. First, we analyze the existing
               research gaps of using eye tracking in the construction
               industry. Then, we follow 3D object identification, diagnostic
               mode and interactive mode to develop a methodology by HTC VIVE
               device with Pupil Labs HTC Vive Binocular Add-on based on the
               research gaps. Finally, an example experiment is provided to
               demonstrate studying hazard identification using eye tracking in
               construction safety. For analyzing the eye movement data from
               the participants, we offer the number of confirmations, the scan
               path and the 3D heatmap of objects in both static and dynamic
               construction site scenes. This paper provides an approach of
               applying eye tracking to gather more data in virtual environment
               for the future cognitive studies and explores the possibility to
               improve human-computer interaction using eye tracking in the
               construction industry.",

              Zone of Proximal Development could be used to inform the design
              of an Interactive Learning Environment called the Ecolab. Two
              aspects of this work have subsequently been used for further
              research. Firstly, there is the interpretation of the ZPD and its
              associated theory that was used to operationalize the ZPD so that
              it could be implemented in software. This interpretation has
              informed further research about how one can model context and its
              impact on learning, which has produced a design framework that
              has been successfully applied across a range of educational
              settings. Secondly, there is the Ecolab software itself. The
              software has been adapted into a variety of versions that have
              supported explorations into how to scaffold learners'
              metacognition, how to scaffold learners' motivation and the
              implications of a learner's goal orientation upon their use of
              the software. The findings from these studies have informed our

              results to demonstrate the importance of providing learners with
              appropriately challenging tasks and flexible support. Vygotsky's

              across different educational fields. The original studies from
              2007 to 2017 were extracted from the PubMed, ProQuest, Scopus,

              Finally, 53 papers were included in the study based on inclusion
              criteria. The educational fields in the ITSs were mainly computer
              sciences (37.73\%). Action-condition rule-based reasoning, data
              mining, and Bayesian network with 33.96\%, 22.64\%, and 20.75\%
              frequency respectively, were the most frequent artificial

              evaluate learners, define and update the learner's model, and

              the system, learner's performance, and experiences were used for

              effectiveness of human tutoring, computer tutoring, and no
              tutoring. ``No tutoring'' refers to instruction that teaches the
              same content without tutoring. The computer tutoring systems were
              divided by their granularity of the user interface interaction
              into answer-based, step-based, and substep-based tutoring
              systems. Most intelligent tutoring systems have step-based or

              tutoring systems (often called CAI, CBT, or CAL systems) have
              answer-based user interfaces. It is widely believed as the
              granularity of tutoring decreases, the effectiveness increases.
              In particular, when compared to No tutoring, the effect sizes of
              answer-based tutoring systems, intelligent tutoring systems, and
              adult human tutors are believed to be d = 0.3, 1.0, and 2.0
              respectively. This review did not confirm these beliefs. Instead,
              it found that the effect size of human tutoring was much lower: d
              = 0.79. Moreover, the effect size of intelligent tutoring systems

               UK, there is currently no systematic pedagogical design or
               evaluation to support interdisciplinary teaching and learning to
               include 4IR skills and knowledge. There is also no clear
               national strategy for schools and FE colleges to follow in how
               to embed 4IR, including Artificial Intelligence, Robotics and
               Internet of Things tools, skills and understanding into their
               teaching. Such a lack of an evidence-based research study
               impacts our young students in particular and education system in
               general, and further discriminates against disadvantaged and
               digitally excluded groups. We applied a design-based research
               methodology framework and worked with two London based schools
               to co-design and deliver a series of workshops to 13-14-year-old
               students introducing them to 4IR skills through engaging
               practical activities. Within the pilot study we engaged with

               patterns for AIeL research with a focus on leading journals,
               countries, disciplines, and applications. In addition, a
               co-citation network analysis was conducted to explore the
               invisible relationships among the core papers of AIeL to reveal
               directions for future research. The analysis is based on a total
               of 86 core AIeL papers accompanied by 1149 citations in
               follow-up studies obtained from the Web of Science. It was found
               that a majority of AIeL studies focused on the development and
               applications of intelligent tutoring systems, followed by using
               AI to facilitate assessment and evaluation in e-learning

               suitable they are for school-to-work programs. An extensive
               survey located 142 workplace simulations, many of which were not
               intended for the school-to-work market. Thirty-nine of the most
               promising simulations were obtained and analyzed to determine
               potential problems that might impede their use in school-to-work
               programs. These simulations were classified according to type
               (e.g., Skill simulations; Role-Playing simulations; and Strategy
               simulations) and then critiqued regarding common problems in
               using them (e.g., usability, learnability, content, and
               available teacher support). We indicate which problems are most
               common and what educators can do to overcome them. We close with
               a propositional analysis of two of the most promising workplace
               simulations that measures the job-specificity and implicitness
               of their content. We conclude that simulations can play an

               on American highways and IBM's Watson trounced the best human
               Jeopardy! players. Digital technologies---with hardware,
               software, and networks at their core---will in the near future
               diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply
               enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many
               tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age
               MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee---two thinkers at the
               forefront of their field---reveal the forces driving the
               reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of
               digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in
               the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced
               infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural items
               that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching
               change. Professions of all kinds---from lawyers to truck
               drivers---will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to
               transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift:
               fewer people are working, and wages are falling even as
               productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and
               up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the
               best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity.
               These include revamping education so that it prepares people for
               the next economy instead of the last one, designing new
               collaborations that pair brute processing power with human
               ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically
               transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The

               Disruptive technologies have increased speculation about what it
               means to be an architect. Innovations simultaneously offer great
               promise and potential risk to design practice. This volume
               identifies the game-changing trends driven by technology, and
               the opportunities they provide for architecture, urbanism and
               design. It advocates for an approach of intelligent control that
               transforms practice with specialist knowledge of technological
               models and systems. It features new developments in automation,
               generative design, augmented reality, videogame urbanism,
               artificial intelligence and robotics, as well as lived
               experiences within a continually shifting landscape. Showcasing
               evolving research, it discusses the cultural, social,
               environmental and political implications of various
               technological trajectories. In doing so it speculates upon
               future urban, spatial, aesthetic and formal possibilities within

               주제를 제시하였다. Labor shortages are a serious problem for Korea's
               construction industry. The problem is both quantitative and
               qualitative. There is a shortage in supply as due to a decrease
               in the influx of new labor, and existing workers are less
               productive as they age. The problem will only get worse as more
               and more major public projects are being planned. Options for
               increasing the labor supply are somewhat limited, and thus
               efforts need to be made to adopt new technologies that can
               improve the productivity and efficiency of field work and their
               processes. This paper introduces seven innovation technologies
               that have the best potential to increase productivity and thus
               reduce the burden of labor shortage problems. These include 1)
               Substitution by use of robotics and automation, 2) development
               and applications of Innovative materials to reduce on site field
               work, 3) increase in productivity through the implementation of
               Information Technology, 4) improved productivity through the
               application of modules, and prefabrication, 5) prevention of
               rework and redesign, 6) diversification of labor by integrating
               labor skills, and 7) improved productivity by standardizing site
               processes.",

  abstract  = "The construction industry is facing an unprecedented, nationwide
               shortage of skilled labor. Construction is the second largest
               employer in the country and according to a Construction Industry
               Institute study 75\% of contractors are experiencing labor
               shortages that are manifesting themselves as cost overruns
               and/or schedule delays. This crisis has been a long time coming
               and our current culture has not helped the problem. Young people
               who don't go to college are seen as ``failures,'' and fewer
               native-born Americans want to work with their hands, outdoors?at
               any wage. In fact a group of high school students surveyed about
               attractive careers listed construction 498th out of 500 possible
               occupations. Not only does construction have an image problem,
               but also the workforce composition of the future is largely
               minority and women, a challenge for an industry that is
               dominantly and traditionally white male. In order to face this
               labor shortage head on, the industry must swallow a bitter pill
               ? Change or continue to accept increases in project cost and
               duration. In response to this challenge, several contractors and
               construction entities have begun to develop innovative new
               programs to recruit more individuals to the construction trades,
               including charter schools, community outreach and active
               participation in high school career guidance by apprenticeship
               programs. More construction companies are realizing that
               diversity practices add economic value to their customers. They
               are establishing mentoring programs for minority and women
               contractors and employing consulting firms to assist them in
               acquiring these new cultural competencies. Other firms are
               focusing their efforts on creating a working atmosphere that
               embraces a diverse workforce, complete with worker training on
               how to effectively deal with the changing workplace culture.
               What positive effects are these approaches having on the overall
               problem? Should these individual efforts to improve the image of
               construction and its thrust for diversity be aligned? This paper
               will attempt to highlight the successes that some programs have
               achieved and what new innovations they invoked in their
               endeavors. Additionally, it will address areas where the efforts
               could successfully be combined.",

  abstract  = "The shortage of skilled workers is one of the greatest
               challenges facing the construction industry. The Construction
               Users Roundtable (CURT) surveyed facility owners on their
               workforce availability in the summer of 2001 and found that 82
               percent of the respondents reported experiencing work force
               shortages on their projects, and 78 percent indicated that the
               trend had worsened over the previous three years. One promising
               solution to relieve the shortage of skilled workers is to
               provide adequate and effective training. Many research efforts
               on construction worker training have been conducted in the past
               decade in order to address the need and benefits of construction
               craft training. However, a quantitative analysis of construction
               craft trainings benefits and costs from the perspective of
               worker, project and company has rarely been carried out.
               Providing quantifiable analysis regarding the benefits and costs
               of training can help to solve the debate existing in the
               industry regarding the value of craft labor training and improve
               the effectiveness of craft training programs. The research
               investigated existing major datasets relevant with construction
               craft training developed by previous research. Meanwhile, as
               part of this research, a craft director training survey was
               administrated to measure training benefits in productivity,
               turnover, absenteeism safety and rework, as well as information
               such as core training subjects and common barriers for training.
               The primary objective of the study is to qualify the outcomes
               and effectiveness of strategies for construction craft training.
               Four secondary objectives are completed to help achieve the
               primary goal: (I) Identify the major characteristics of
               construction training and major factors affecting construction
               training; (II) Quantitatively measure the outcomes of
               construction training on the individual and project/company
               level; (III) Develop benefit-cost ratio models based on the
               survey administrated by the study as well as existing industry
               data; and (IV) Perform a skill affinity analysis to identify
               real multiskilling patterns among craft workers in order to
               adopt multiskilling training strategies in the construction

               successive Conservative governments have enacted labor

               challenges lately in the context of geostrategic forces that are
               shaping our world. Recent technological changes, combined with
               shifts in global economic power, accelerating urbanization, and
               demographic changes have put pressure on the VET to become more
               responsive to the needs of the labour market and society.
               E-learning has been seen as an effective way of improving the
               quality of teaching and learning in VET schools due to its
               various forms. Nevertheless, there has been some disagreement in
               the litearture on the advantages and disadvantages of the use of
               of e-learning in VET. Besides, some studies recently reported a

  abstract  = "AbstractManufacturing in advanced open economies has experienced
               significant disruption. Rapid technological change, outsourcing
               and off shoring have beset manufacturing resulting in a general
               and steady decline in manufacturing employment. Despite this
               turbulence, there remains a strong nostalgia for manufacturing
               resulting in frequent public policy discussion about how best to
               revitalise the industry. A popular view is that a strong
               manufacturing industry relies upon an equally strong vocational,
               education and training (VET) system to provide requisite skill
               needs. Given the dramatic pace of change in the manufacturing
               industry do such arguments still hold true? This paper considers
               this question through an examination of what the revitalisation
               of US manufacturing means for employment and skills needs and
               the extent to which US?s decentralised and largely eroded VET
               system serves as a barrier to the industry?s revitalisation.
               Drawing upon a mixed method approach that includes primary and
               secondary data collected in three US cities, the paper argues
               that the focus on needing to have a strong VET system overlooks
               the emergence of flexible micro-skill ecosystems that evolve to
               address local skill needs. These micro skill eco-systems open
               the prospects for skills and training innovations to meet

               understanding of the students' behavior. This chapter begins by
               providing an overview of intelligent tutoring systems. The
               chapter comments on competing research goals in the field,
               followed by descriptions of two successful systems: (1) the
               Pittsburgh urban math project algebra tutor project and (2) the

               real-world educational environments with substantial success.
               This chapter briefly describes the underlying theory and
               implementation of each system, to motivate later discussions. A
               description of the standard components in an intelligent

  abstract = "Adaptive collaborative learning support (ACLS) involves
              collaborative learning environments that adapt their
              characteristics, and sometimes provide intelligent hints and
              feedback, to improve individual students' collaborative
              interactions. ACLS often involves a system that can automatically
              assess student dialogue, model effective and ineffective
              collaboration, and provide relevant support. While there is
              evidence that ACLS can improve student learning, little is known
              about why systems that incorporate ACLS are effective. Does
              relevant support improve student interactions by providing
              just-in-time feedback, or do students who believe they are
              receiving relevant support feel more accountable for the
              collaboration, and thus more motivated to improve their
              interactions? In this paper, we describe an adaptive system we
              have developed to support help-giving during peer tutoring in
              high school algebra: the Adaptive Peer Tutoring Assistant (APTA).
              To validate our approach, we conducted a controlled study that
              demonstrated that our system provided students with more relevant
              support and was more effective at improving student learning than
              parallel nonadaptive conditions. Our contributions involve
              generalizable techniques for implementing ACLS that can function
              adaptively and effectively, and the finding that adaptive support
              does indeed improve student learning because of the relevance of

              The paper seeks to identify areas where there are skilled labour
              shortages in the building construction industry within the
              Central Region. A survey research approach was employed to get
              the study population that consisted of project managers, site
              engineers, site foremen and engineers working with contactors.
              Questionnaires were designed based on the research specific
              objectives and used as the main instrument for data collection.
              Findings from the study revealed that the shortage of skilled
              manpower was from painters and decorators, electricians and tile
              workers. Further findings showed that skilled labour shortage was
              caused by socio--economic conditions, external forces, job
              attractiveness, job characteristics, job satisfaction, industry
              limitations and personal factors. Employees should be encouraged

               commonly undertaken in many industries. What is lacking from the

               underpinning KM and particularly for how tacit knowledge informs
               the KM space. Research over decades shows tacit knowledge
               underpins all other forms of knowledge, enabling the
               interpretation and judicious application of knowledge, leading
               (at its highest levels) to the concept of wisdom. As an academic

               of AI and KM in unison, providing at the same time a strong

              teaching online during the Covid-19 pandemic. Thematic analysis
              of survey and interview data show that teachers engaged regularly
              in emotional support of students, and a pedagogy of care was
              discernible in the ways teachers described seeking out signals
              that the students' needs were being met online. However,
              technology mediated communication made this more difficult in
              online teaching than face-to-face, increasing teachers' emotional
              labour. Teachers' efforts to achieve interaction with, and
              feedback from, students to inform their teaching approach,
              incurred a heavy burden of emotional labour that is

  abstract  = "Background Spatial skills are crucial for carpentry and are a
               major learning objective in the initial vocational training of
               carpenter apprentices. Carpenters specifically need to develop
               the capability to switch between two-dimensional (2D) and
               three-dimensional (3D) representations. Previous studies have
               explored spatial skills, but never in the context of vocational
               education and training (VET). This study sheds light on the
               level and evolution of spatial skills in the initial vocational
               training of carpenter apprentices in Switzerland. Methods In
               this study, 726 subjects (98 females) who were either carpenter
               apprentices, apprentices of another profession, or high school
               students, took a test on spatial skills with three parts: mental
               rotation, paper folding, and orthographic projections. The first
               two parts are widely used tests for spatial skills, while the
               last one was specifically designed to address the 2D-3D
               transition that is a core skill of carpenters. Results Carpenter
               apprentices do have higher spatial skills than would be expected
               given their general school level. In particular, their spatial
               skills were found to be similar to those of high school students
               and superior to those of apprentices of another profession.
               Carpenters' spatial skills improve over the course of their
               apprenticeship. These findings confirm that spatial skills are
               trainable and suggest that the high spatial skills level of
               carpenter apprentices is due to a selection bias as well as to
               the training that they receive during their apprenticeship.
               Conclusions Carpenter apprentices improve their spatial skills
               over the time of their initial vocational training. As spatial
               skills are crucial in this profession, there is a need to
               develop further solutions that encourage further improvement of
               teaching and learning activities for spatial skills.",

               specialised, upper-secondary vocational education (VE)
               programmes in the Netherlands with respect to their graduates'
               position in the labour market. The data are from three cohorts
               of the Dutch VE Monitor, a survey of VE graduates 18 months
               after graduation. The programmes of the highest level---Level
               4---of the school-based learning route are investigated. To
               separate narrow from broad programmes, a novel criterion is
               used, based on the argument that the match between education and
               a job within a narrow programme's occupational domain is better
               than outside that domain and that, for a broad programme, such a
               match does not differ significantly between the programme's
               domain and outside it. This study shows that graduates from
               narrow education programmes have a less favourable labour market
               position than graduates from broad programmes. They have a
               greater chance of being unemployed and are more often mismatched
               in their jobs, both horizontally and vertically. They earn less
               in any case, particularly if their job is outside their
               occupational domain or below their level. They consequently
               experience worse career opportunities and many are more
               dissatisfied with their jobs. To solve this problem, it would be
               better to focus on realising a shift in the influx of students
               from narrow to broad education programmes instead of broadening
               all narrow programmes. Besides this shift to broader programmes,
               offering broad variants of narrow programmes while maintaining
               the narrow, specialist variants could be highly allocation

  abstract  = "That so many employers in various sectors continue to train
               apprentices despite incurring substantial costs can be taken as
               prima facie evidence of there being ways to mitigate the
               investment risk. The main downside in the English apprenticeship
               system is that the overall levels of employer engagement and
               training volumes are considered sub-optimal and in reality there
               is a fine balance which can put the performance of the firm and
               the wider economy at risk due to insufficient skill development.
               This paper draws on data from the Net Costs and Benefits of
               Training to Employers series of studies (carried out between
               1994 and 2012). Each of the original studies consisted of case
               studies of employers in particular sectors in which the costs
               associated with training an apprentice were considered against
               the benefits employers obtain through this activity during the
               training period. Data in the original studies was collected in
               face-to-face interviews with the employers. The data were
               aligned with an accounting framework that captured the relevant
               costs and benefits of apprenticeship training from the
               perspective of the employer. Calculations were carried out to
               also indicate the payback period (i.e. the period after training
               has taken over which an employer could be expected to recoup any
               net cost they had incurred). We present the most comprehensive
               available estimates of the net costs of apprenticeship to
               employers in England to illustrate how costs vary across sectors
               and how, for most employers, engaging in apprenticeship training
               leaves them with a net cost at the end of the training period.
               The extent of this net cost at the end of the formal training
               period is found to vary substantially by sector and level of
               apprenticeship and over time, in real terms, the net costs of
               training have tended to increase across all sectors. Employers
               reported a range of rationales for training apprentices; from
               supply-led (e.g. where participation was prompted by training
               providers offering it for free) to more demand-led (e.g. where
               employers saw apprenticeship as necessary for acquiring needed
               skills) reasons. Employer sensitivity to various cost parameters
               depended upon where on the supply- to demand-led continuum they
               fell. Despite various policy changes since the mid-1990s,
               employers' engagement in apprenticeships in England has not
               achieved a significant volume and there are still financial
               risks attached to investing in this form of training. Even with
               the latest reforms of funding and delivery embodied in the move
               to apprenticeship standards and the introduction of an employer
               levy, there is no guarantee that more employers will be willing
               to train apprentices or that those who already engage will train
               more. There is a need to consider various ways of reducing
               employers' risk without inducing unintended behavioural changes
               that counter overall policy objectives.",

              systematically distinguish between disruptive breakthroughs and

              million research teams---publishing in eleven fields of research
              from 1961 to 2020. On average, we document a robust and
              significant negative impact of remote collaboration on
              breakthrough discovery. However, beginning in the 2010s, the
              negative impact tapers off and even becomes positive. We provide

  author    = "Moodie, Gavin",
  abstract  = "Abstract This article observes that vocational education and
               training's identity has been founded on four types of
               characteristics: epistemological, teleological, hierarchical and
               pragmatic. No single characteristic is found to be adequate to
               identify vocational education and training across jurisdictions,
               and across historical periods. Both Rushbrook and Stevenson seek
               for vocational education and training what Rushbrook calls an
               ?abstracted institutional teleology?. Yet such a quest may
               degenerate into essentialism, and in any case is vulnerable to
               being made obsolete by the changes that vocational education and
               training is meant to be stimulating and to equip us for life.
               The article concludes by arguing for a definition of vocational
               education and training which is a compound of the four general
               characteristics considered.",

              lining with a square base area of 80 $\times$ 80 cm and 140 cm in
              height. Due to the excellent conservation of the oak timbers,
              studies of technological details and precise tree-ring dating
              were possible. The used trees were felled in the years 5256/55
              BC, which makes this well the oldest dendrochronologically dated
              archaeological wooden construction worldwide. It is the third
              well from the Early Neolithic period that has been discovered in
              the Czech Republic within the last four years. The design
              consists of grooved corner posts with inserted planks. This type
              of construction reveals advanced technical know-how and, till
              now, is the only known type from this region and time period.
              Thanks to the combination of annually resolved and absolutely
              dated tree-ring widths (TRWs), the Czech oak TRW chronology has
              been significantly extended back to 5481 BC. Wood anatomical

              (Quercus spp.) and hazel (Corylus spp.), indicating a local

              and technology, characteristic material properties, design and
              connections. Making use of general information concerning the

              references for background information. In view of ongoing global

              construction: The case of cross laminated timber",
  author   = "D'Amico, Bernardino and Pomponi, Francesco and Hart, Jim",
  abstract = "The building and construction sector is a large contributor to
              anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions and consumes the vastest
              amount of natural resources. Widely considered a
              hard-to-decarbonise sector, improvements in buildings and
              construction are of fundamental importance for national and
              global targets to combat climate change. At material level,
              mitigation opportunities exist in terms of efficiency (using less
              of the same material) and substitution (using a different
              material). This article investigates the latter, with a global
              focus on the use of cross laminated timber to replace concrete
              floors in steel structural systems. This approach, whilst
              innovative, does not require any technological development nor
              upskilling of current professional practice, thus making it an
              immediately viable solution to accelerate decarbonisation. We
              combine Material Flow Analysis with Life Cycle Assessment across
              both spatial and temporal dimensions, accounting for different
              levels of uptake of the proposed hybrid construction in the next
              30 years. Results show that greenhouse gas emissions saving
              potentials range between 20 and 80 Mt CO2e (95\% confidence
              interval) with an average around 50 Mt CO2e in the case of full
              uptake of the hybrid construction system by 2050. Our analysis
              does not account for carbon sequestration potential in timber,
              which would make the savings much greater. Still, the overall
              savings represent a 1.5\% reduction of the annual greenhouse gas
              emissions generally attributed to construction, thus making it a
              non-trivial contribution to progress towards global targets of
              net-zero carbon buildings.",
